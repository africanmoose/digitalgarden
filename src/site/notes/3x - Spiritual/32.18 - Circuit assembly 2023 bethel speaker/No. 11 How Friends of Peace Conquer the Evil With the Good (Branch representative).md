# 0:00 FRIENDS OF PEACE MUST BE CONQUERORS (3 min.)

- Peaceful Christians must be fighters, and we must fight to win 
- **Read Romans 12:21** not conquered by evil
   - The words “do not let yourself be conquered” indicate that we can win 
   - The command “keep conquering” shows that our fight is not a single battle but an ongoing war
   - “evil” refers to forces that try to pull us back into Satan’s world (w07 7/1 27 ¶1)
   - “Evil” includes the actions and attitudes of those who oppose true worship, including unseen wicked spirit forces (Eph 6:12, 13)

Romans chapter 12 teaches us how Jehovah helps friends of peace to be conquerors

# 0:03 STRIVE “TO THINK SO AS TO HAVE A SOUND MIND” (8 min.)

How can you resist the evil thinking of “this system of things”? 
**[Read Romans 12:1, 2]**

Use your “power of reason” to understand what God requires, and then act to bring your thinking into harmony with the “perfect will of God” (_w07_ 7/1 23 ¶5-6)

Live a clean life in harmony with what God approves in order to become “a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God” (_w09_ 10/15 3 ¶2-3)

Satan’s system of things promotes a haughty, me-first attitude (2Ti 3:1-3)

To have a proper view of others, maintain a balanced and reasonable view of yourself **[Read Romans 12:3, 16]**

Cultivate humility in order “to have a sound mind” and promote peace (_w20.07_ 7 ¶16-17)

Imitate Jesus’ example (_w20.07_ 4 ¶9)

Acknowledge that God has given a “measure of faith” to each Christian, and consider others superior to yourself (Php 2:3; _w09_ 10/15 4 ¶7-8)

# 0:11 USE YOUR GOD-GIVEN GIFTS TO BUILD OTHERS UP (8 min.)

Satan uses evil schemes to try to break up our Christian unity (Eph 4:27)

He would like to use personal differences or a spirit of competition to divide us (_w07_ 10/1 29-30 ¶15-16)

Like each part of the human body, each of us has a different role in the congregation and each of us is valuable **[Read Romans 12:4, 5]**

Avoid the tendency to compare God-given gifts or to envy those of others (Ga 6:4; 1Pe 2:1)

Conquer the Devil’s schemes by modestly acknowledging that others also have gifts that build up the congregation **[Read Romans 12:6-8]**

Humbly use your gifts to build others up (1Pe 4:10; _w09_ 1/15 13-14 ¶7-9)

# 0:19 CULTIVATE QUALITIES THAT PROMOTE PEACE AND UNITY (12 min.)

The world is divided by hatred and strife

Unhypocritical love and an abhorrence for what is wicked promote peace and unity **[Read Romans 12:9, 10]**

“Tender affection for one another” unites us (Col 3:14)

Our zeal for Jehovah’s worship unites us **[Read Romans 12:11, 12]** (_w10_ 12/15 14-15 ¶16-17)

Zealous activity coupled with frequent prayer keeps our hope alive and helps us to “endure under tribulation” (Heb 6:11, 12)

Greed and the love of money and power result in “all sorts of injurious things” (1Ti 6:9, 10)

Be generous and show empathy **[Read Romans 12:13, 15]**

Look for opportunities to show hospitality

Show fellow feeling under all circumstances (_w09_ 10/15 6-7 ¶15-16)

# 0:31 REMAIN PEACEABLE AT ALL TIMES (11 min.)

People in Satan’s world are often harsh, and some persecute us (Mt 10:16-18; Joh 15:20)

Avoid confrontation whenever possible **[Read Romans 12:14, 17, 18]**

Speak kindly to “those who persecute” (Lu 6:27, 28; Ac 7:60; _w07_ 7/1 24 ¶9-11)

Retaliation is common in Satan’s world

Do not “return evil for evil” (1Th 5:15; 1Pe 2:23)

[Briefly relate an experience that illustrates the wisdom of not retaliating. You may use either a local experience or one from our publications. See, for example, _The Watchtower,_ October 15, 2009, page 8, paragraphs 3-4]

Strive to “be peaceable with all men” (“peacemakers” study note on Mt 5:9, _nwtsty;_ _w09_ 10/15 9 ¶7‑9)

[Briefly relate an experience that illustrates how a Christian can pursue peace. You may use a local experience or one from our publications. See, for example, _The Watchtower,_ June 15, 2010, page 17, paragraph 11]

Treat enemies with kindness, and wait on Jehovah to repay evildoers **[Read Romans 12:19, 20]**

“‘I will repay,’ says Jehovah” (2Th 1:6; _w09_ 10/15 10 ¶10-12)

“Heap fiery coals on his head” (Pr 25:21, 22; _w07_ 7/1 26 ¶16-17)

# 0:42 KEEP DOING GOOD UNTIL THE CONQUEST IS FINISHED (2 min.)

Satan is the source of all evil (Joh 8:44; 1Jo 5:19)

Friends of peace must keep conquering evil until Satan and his wicked world are brought to an end (Ro 12:21)

**Review question: How can we “keep conquering the evil with the good”?**

**Answer: Romans 12:2, 6, 10, 18; we transform our minds to Jehovah’s way of thinking, use our gifts for the good of our brothers, display qualities that promote peace, and strive to be peaceable with all men**

Do not let up in your fight against evil

Be a force for peace inside and outside the congregation; be “aglow with the spirit”; use your gifts to help others be conquerors; show tender affection; be humble, modest, peaceable, and hospitable

“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good”
