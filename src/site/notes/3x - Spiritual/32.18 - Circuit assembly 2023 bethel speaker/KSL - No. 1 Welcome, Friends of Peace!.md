# 0:00 WHAT IS “A FRIEND OF PEACE”? (4 min.)

Welcome, Friends of Peace!

During his earthly ministry, Jesus looked for friends of peace and taught his disciples to do the same **[Read Luke 10:6]** (“friend of peace” study note on Luke 10:6, _nwtsty_)

How can we identify friends of peace?
- They are conscious of their spiritual need (Mt 5:3 KSL)
- They are willing to listen and to be taught the truth (Mt 10:11, 13; Ac 13:48 KSL (rightly disposed for everlasting life))
- They seek righteousness and meekness (Zep 2:3 KSL)
- They desire to be at peace with God, so they humbly accept his provision for salvation

When such a person becomes a believer, he continues to be “a friend of peace”

# 0:08 CONTINUE TO HELP FRIENDS OF PEACE (6 min.)

As Jesus’ followers, we have the privilege of finding and teaching friends of peace 
- make disciples....Jesus with us

- Because we are not able to read hearts, we cannot identify such ones until we witness to them—‍perhaps many times 
	- _Ec 11:5, 6; - not let your hand rest_ KSI vs 5
- So our words and manner must always be gracious, mild, and respectful (Col 4:5, 6) KSI vs 6
- 

- Friends of peace become believers when God makes the seed of truth grow in their heart 

Most here today are baptized friends of peace, so let us continue to help one another maintain our peace with God and with our brothers and sisters 

- That includes praying for one another

## Review question: How can we identify friends of peace?

**Answer: Luke 10:6; friends of peace desire to be at peace with God; these include both believers and those who are rightly disposed to become such**

We are grateful that Jehovah has welcomed us as friends of peace

Let us do all we can to help others benefit from the peace that is found among God’s people
