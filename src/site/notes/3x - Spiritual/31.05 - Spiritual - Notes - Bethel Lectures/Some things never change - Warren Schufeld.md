[ ] David not given any explanation about why so long before taking over kingship.
[ ] What helped David?
[ ] 1 Sam 26:8,9- abishai let me pin Saul to the ground. David modestly showed Jah in control. Not experience frustration when we think matters could be handled better. Jah not change mind over who would be king. Was David helped in kingship by years of training? Years later when told Solomon would build temple...did what Jonathan did for him.
[ ] Number 11:24- Moses change in theocratic structure 70 men. Spirit off Moses. 26 two still in camp...eldad and medad behave as prophets. I wish all Jehovah's people were prophets.meekness helped him.blend of humility and mildness. Christian overseer not feel challenged by good ideas of others.part of assignment to bring out best in them.

[ ] Have a balanced healthy view of change change is opportunity to experience jahs friendship in new ways.
[ ] Amos sheep herder. Humble background sent to highest levels of govt to king jeroboam. Assignment comes to end. Back to wilderness of Judah. Maybe felt that best years behind him? He had the greatest assignment...Bible writing. Not feel, 'oh great I have a great future behind me'
[ ] Is 43:10-,13 Jah always the same. When I act who can prevent it?
