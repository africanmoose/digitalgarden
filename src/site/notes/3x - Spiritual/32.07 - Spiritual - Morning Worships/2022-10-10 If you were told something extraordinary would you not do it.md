*** it-1 p. 1157 Humility ***
A person can achieve a state of humility by reasoning on his relationship to God and to his fellowmen, as outlined in the Bible, and then practicing the principles learned. A Hebrew word, hith·rap·pesʹ, translated “humble yourself,” means, literally, “stamp yourself down.

(Proverbs 12:15) . . .The way of the fool is right in his own eyes, But the wise one accepts advice.

*** w22 February p. 8 par. 2 “Listen to the Words of the Wise” ***
Our theme text encourages us to “listen to the words of the wise.” (Prov. 22:17) No human knows everything; there is always someone who has greater knowledge or experience than we do. (Read Proverbs 12:15 and footnote.) So listening to counsel is a sign of humility. It indicates that we are aware of our limitations; we realize that we need help to reach our goals. Wise King Solomon wrote under inspiration: “There is accomplishment through many advisers [or “counselors,” ftn.].”—Prov. 15:22.

*** w22 February p. 12 par. 12 “Listen to the Words of the Wise” ***
What can help us to accept counsel? We need to be humble by remembering just how imperfect we really are and how foolish we can be at times. As discussed earlier, Job had the wrong viewpoint. But he later adjusted his thinking, and Jehovah blessed him for it. Why? Because Job was humble. He proved his humility by accepting the counsel that Elihu gave him, even though Elihu was much younger than he was. (Job 32:6, 7) Humility will likewise help us apply counsel, even when we feel that we do not deserve it or when the one giving it is younger than we are. An elder in Canada says, “Since we do not see ourselves as others see us, how can we progress if no one counsels us?” Who among us does not need to make progress in cultivating the fruitage of the spirit and in carrying out the Christian ministry?—Read Psalm 141:5.

*** w01 10/15 p. 20 par. 15 Acquire a Heart Agreeable to Jehovah ***
Just as adding the proper supplements may enhance the physical soil, so our cultivating humility, hunger for spirituality, trust, godly fear, and love for God can enrich our figurative heart. Humility softens the heart, helping us to become more teachable. Jehovah said to Judean King Josiah: “For the reason that your heart was soft so that you humbled yourself because of Jehovah at your hearing what I have spoken . . . and began weeping before me, I, even I, have heard.” (2 Kings 22:19) Josiah’s heart was humble and receptive. Humility enabled Jesus’ “unlettered and ordinary” disciples to grasp and apply spiritual truths that escaped “wise and intellectual” men. (Acts 4:13; Luke 10:21) May we “humble ourselves before our God” as we try to acquire a heart agreeable to Jehovah.—Ezra 8:21.

*** w06 4/1 pp. 6-7 Understanding the Bible—What Will Help You? ***
A major challenge in understanding the Bible is that of being teachable. A person may find it difficult to accept new ideas from someone who appears to be lowly. Yet, the apostles of Jesus Christ were “unlettered and ordinary” men. (Acts 4:13) Explaining why, Paul wrote: “You behold his calling of you, brothers, that not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth; but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame.” (1 Corinthians 1:26, 27) If you find that being taught by a lowly person challenges your humility, remember that he or she is merely the means used by God to teach you. What privilege could be greater than to be taught by Jehovah, our “Grand Instructor”?—Isaiah 30:20; 54:13.
The Syrian military commander Naaman was someone who found it challenging to receive instruction from a lowly one. Seeking a cure for his leprosy, he went to see Jehovah’s prophet Elisha. But God’s instructions for a cure were relayed to Naaman through a servant. The message and the way it was presented challenged Naaman’s humility, so that he at first refused to obey the word of God’s prophet. Later, Naaman changed his attitude and was healed. (2 Kings 5:9-14) We face a similar challenge when we turn to the Bible. We may learn that to be cured spiritually and morally, we need to follow a new way of life. Will we have the humility to allow someone to teach us what we need to do? Only those with a teachable attitude can enjoy an understanding of the Bible.
