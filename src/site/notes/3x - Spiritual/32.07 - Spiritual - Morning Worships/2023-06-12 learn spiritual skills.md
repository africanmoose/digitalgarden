The Little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation.—_Isa 60:22_

## Intro

- Growth 1914 5,100 -> 2023 8,600,000

## Main Points

- What is my individual contribution? maybe seems insignificant
- "These precious things bring wtih them various skills and abilities, along with a willing spirit to join in the preaching of the good news of the kingdom. With teh help of these precious mmen and women, the preaching work is being carried out in 240 countries and literature is being produced in over 1,000 languages"
	- pleasure to have many new ones in our bethel family
	- many perhaps unseen serving in LDC, remote volunteers
	- many have special skills, and we truly value those who use their skills to further kingdom interests.
	- Many enter Bethel service without any special education or skills. That was true of Abel, who has served at Bethel in Mexico for 15 years. “Bethel has been a real school for me,” he remarks. “I have learned to operate very sophisticated printing presses. I know that with this knowledge, I could make a lot of money outside of Bethel, but I would not have what I enjoy here—a tranquil, satisfying life without the worries and competitiveness of many commercial workplaces. I feel that I have received the finest possible education, one that has helped me to develop both spiritually and intellectually. I could not have received such spiritual benefits even in the best university.”

- pr 22:29 - skills
	- maybe think of a carpenter![2023-06-12-carpenter.jpeg](/img/user/3x%20-%20Spiritual/32.07%20-%20Spiritual%20-%20Morning%20Worships/2023-06-12-carpenter.jpeg)
	- Do not treat any assignment you are given as if it were unworthy of your time. Strive to improve your skills. (Prov. 22:29) 
- think of jesus 
	- had a secular skill: known as 'the carpenter'
	![2023-06-12-jesus carpenetr.jpeg](/img/user/3x%20-%20Spiritual/32.07%20-%20Spiritual%20-%20Morning%20Worships/2023-06-12-jesus%20carpenetr.jpeg)
	- Jesus better known for spiritual skills
	- The more absorbed you are in your spiritual activities and assignments, the quicker you will progress and the greater your joy will be.

- Coming to Bethel is the best thing that ever happened to me. Here education never stops. And here education is, not for my own personal achievement, but for Jehovah. Here my work will never be in vain.

Summary:
 - little one become a thousand: we all have a part to play
	 - new ones bring in skills and abilities
	 - some may not have any special eduction or skills, but learn skills here in bethel
 - regardless of our physical skills and abilities, most important is developing spiritual skills and qualities

***** w16 August pp. 21-23 pars. 5-13 Do You See the Need to Make Spiritual Progress? *****



**11** _Develop spiritual qualities._ By reading God’s Word and meditating on it, we can develop wisdom, insight, good judgment, knowledge, thinking ability, and soundness of mind. Such qualities are vital for those taking the lead in true worship. (Prov. 1:1-4; Titus 1:7-9) And as we read our Bible-based publications, we can discern God’s thinking on many matters. Daily, we face issues involving entertainment, dress and grooming, managing money, and getting along with others. By applying what we learn from the Bible, we can make decisions that please Jehovah.

**12** _Prove yourself trustworthy._ Whether we are brothers or sisters, we need to do our best to care for any theocratic assignment we receive. As governor, Nehemiah had to fill positions of responsibility among God’s people. Whom did he appoint? He used those who were God-fearing, trustworthy, and reliable. (Neh. 7:2; 13:12, 13) Today as well, “what is expected of stewards is that they be found faithful.” (1 Cor. 4:2) Fine works do not go unnoticed.—**Read 1** **Timothy 5:25.**

**13** _Let Jehovah refine you._ What can you do if others treat you unfairly? Perhaps you can straighten out the matter quickly. At times, though, by vigorously defending yourself, you make a problem worse. Joseph’s brothers mistreated him, but he did not harbor resentment. Later, Joseph was falsely accused and unjustly imprisoned. However, he let Jehovah guide him through difficult times. The result? “The saying of Jehovah is what refined him.” (Ps. 105:19) When those tests ended, Joseph qualified for a special assignment. (Gen. 41:37-44; 45:4-8) As you deal with thorny problems, pray for wisdom, act and speak with mildness, and look to God for strength. Jehovah will help you.—**Read 1** **Peter 5:10.**


    

***** w94 9/1 p. 16 par. 12 Rejoice in Jehovah! *****

12 How faith strengthening it is for Christians today to see Bible prophecies fulfilled before their very eyes! Consider, for example, the words of Isaiah 60:22: “The little one himself will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.” At the Kingdom’s birth in 1914, only 5,100—a little one—were actively preaching. But during the past five years, the size of the worldwide brotherhood has been increasing at the average rate of 5,628 newly baptized Witnesses each week! In 1993, a peak of 4,709,889 active ministers was reached. Just imagine! This means that “the little one” of 1914 is literally close to becoming “a thousand”!

The same can be true in your case. “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry,” the Bible says. (Psalm 126:5) How is that verse relevant? Well, if you work hard to apply right principles under difficult conditions, your tears will eventually be replaced with joy as you experience God’s blessing.

**_Training for future service._** While it was God’s purpose to deliver the Hebrews by the hand of Moses, God’s due time had not yet arrived; neither was Moses yet qualified to serve over God’s people. He had to undergo another 40 years of training. The qualities of patience, meekness, humility, long-suffering, mildness of temper, self-control, and learning to wait on Jehovah needed to be developed in him to a higher degree, in order for him to be the fitting one to lead God’s people. He had to be groomed and prepared to endure the discouragements, disappointments, and hardships he would encounter, and to handle with loving-kindness, calmness, and strength the multitude of problems a great nation would present. He possessed much learning, and his training as a member of Pharaoh’s household had doubtless given him dignity, confidence, and poise and had accentuated his ability to organize and command. But the lowly occupation of shepherding in Midian provided the training needed to develop fine qualities that would be even more important for the task ahead of him. Similarly, David underwent rigorous training, even after being anointed by Samuel, and Jesus Christ was tried, tested, and proved, to be perfected as King and High Priest forever. “He [Christ] learned obedience from the things he suffered; and after he had been made perfect he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.”—Heb 5:8, 9.

Stephen’s account delivered before the Sanhedrin includes a number of facts concerning Jewish history that are not found in the Hebrew Scriptures: Moses’ Egyptian education, his age of 40 when he fled Egypt, the 40-year duration of his stay in Midian before returning to Egypt, and the role of angels in giving the Mosaic Law.—Ac 7:22, 23, 30, 32, 38.

***** w20 August pp. 24-25 pars. 20-23 You Have a Place in Jehovah’s Congregation! *****


**23** Each one of us is precious to Jehovah. He wants us to be part of his family. If we take time to meditate on what we can do to build up our brothers and sisters and then work hard to fill that role, we will be less likely to feel that we do not belong in the congregation!

    

***** es23 p. 90 September *****

We can increase our joy by becoming absorbed in whatever we are given to do in Jehovah’s service. Be “intensely occupied” in the preaching work, and be fully involved in congregation activities. (Acts 18:5; Heb. 10:24, 25) Go to the meetings prepared to give upbuilding comments on the material that is being studied. Take seriously any student assignments you have on the midweek meeting. If you are asked to help out with a certain task in the congregation, be punctual and reliable. Do not treat any assignment you are given as if it were unworthy of your time. Strive to improve your skills. (Prov. 22:29) The more absorbed you are in your spiritual activities and assignments, the quicker you will progress and the greater your joy will be. (Gal. 6:4) You will also find it easier to rejoice with others when they receive a privilege that you would have liked to receive.
