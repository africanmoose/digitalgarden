### Quotes
- "The wise person does not rise up in revolt. Having a heart motivated by wisdom, he realizes that there is a proper time for action and a right way to put up with an oppressive ruler. Open rebellion would mean courting disaster. Good judgment, on the other hand, will prevent a person from acting at an inopportune time. ([Ps. 37:1-7](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977641/8/0)) For “every affair” there is a proper time and judgment or manner of dealing. So a person is just asking for trouble if he disregards this fact and acts in haste. Imperfect humans already have enough problems without adding to them by acting rashly, ignoring that “there exists a time and judgment even for every affair.” Besides, no one can be sure just what the future holds. Even men in authority die. Keeping this fact in mind can help one to endure a difficult situation. The rule of the tyrant cannot continue indefinitely. Everything in this imperfect system has its end."
- Even where rulership is harsh and arbitrary, the wise individual will not rise in revolt. He realizes that there is a “time” or season when something will happen to change things for the better. But since he does not know “just how” that change will occur, the prudent course for the present is for him to go about his business, using sound judgment in dealing with unpleasant aspects of daily life.​
