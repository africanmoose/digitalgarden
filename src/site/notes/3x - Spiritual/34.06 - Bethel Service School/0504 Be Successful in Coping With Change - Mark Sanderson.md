## Notes

- not surprised when we see change
- Ezekiel 1:20,21 - Jahs organization is on the move
- Ez 1:14 - moving like flashes of lighting
- may receive a phone call/letter and our life changes completely
- Dan 12:4 - true knowlege will become abundant
- Pr 4:18 - path of righteous get brighter and brighter
- leader is JC. is he stagnant...nothing moving...nothing happening
- re 6:1 - went out conquering and to complete his conquest

- human imperfection - adjusting to change is not easy.

### 1. Advancing spiritual light

- We expect to see changed light
- What if it involves a teaching that is close to your heart
- May have to shred our talks if light has changed
- First centuy jews who became christians....before met in herods temple...then now as christian had to meet in a backroom.
- Acts 10:23,24 - Peter and vision of the unclean animals....starts to understand what jah is telling him. gets teh new truth and announces it:
- Acts 10:34,35 - we take this for granted but this was a new truth.
- Acts 10:44 - if there was any doubt, holy spirit poured out upon people of the nations
- was a huge change for jews. had to befriend uncircumcised, sit at same table etc.
- Peters spiritual discernment allowed him to see the new light
- today needs us to follow lead of GB
- had to be willing to submit and not cling to his own ideas, lowliness of mind.
- 1914, macmillan gave talk 'this is the last talk i will be giving'
- oct 2nd all there 1914, russel claps his hands 'gentile times have ended'
- russel changed and assigned talk to macmillan. macmillan not sensitive, accepted assignment and gave teh talk and discussed....
- our adjustments in understanding dont change the promise of everlasting life.
- Be humble. dont be in love with my own ideas but follow the direction of the chariot

### 2. Needs of org change

- there was tape duplication department in brooklyn, with more than 100 people. We no longer need this department today.
- Anyone upset that department is gone? no. but what if you were the overseer? or worked there with all your friends? change would be difficult.
- Position JC had in heaven....from very beginning. universe 13.8bn years old. JC in heaven longer than that. how close they were.
- Phil 2:5,6

###### 7
No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and became human.[^4]


</div></div>

- great understatement - emptied himself. going from high position to being one cell in body of mary. from spokes man of jah to have to be taught how to speak. from heaven with angels to humans full of imperfection. 
- Psalm 40:7,8 - to do your will is my delight. JC delighted to do jahs will. no reason to believe that JC was the only spirit creature who could do this assignment, but JC wanted to do it.
- not interested in what position he would have, are people looking at him etc. no, focussed on pleasing jah.
- Edwin Skinner - accpeted difficult assignment.
	- rutherford: 'do you mind what part of the world you work in?' 'no' 'how would you like to go to india?' 3 weeks later on the way to india. their territory: india, myanmar, afghanistan, iran, sri lanka
	- joked 'only the first 20 years are hard'
	- bro wallen one thing remember about skinner: "he never complained"
- Focus on jahs will. maintain humble view of ourselves. 
- whatever job that needs to be done, get busy doing it.

### 3. Changes in our own role

- may be more responsibility, but also may be less.
- Usually when we are taking on more responsibility we dont have a problem, but when its less may not have same degree of joy.
- Deut 34:7 - 120 yrs but eyes not dim, strength not departed. fully expected that he would take isrealites into the promised land even though he thought that he continued to train other people
- Nu 11:28, 29 Moses always training Joshua
- de 3:23-26 - moses really wanted to enter teh promised land. jah: 'never speak to me again about this matter' moses must have really asked jah until jah said this.
- nu 27:15 - 17 - moses successful with coping with change - asked someone to be assigned to shepherd the people.
- de 3:28 - commission joshua and encourage him and strengthen him. job that moses wanted but he was told to strenghten his successor. 
- de 31:7 - moses 'be courageous and strong, for you are the one who will bring this people into the land....'
- Robert J Marin
	- one of 7 brothers imprisoned with rutherford
	- took lead in setting up factory
	- man of great faith...worldy printers said that they would fail in 6 months but they trusted in jah.
	- all teh time working, training other people, helping them to grow
	- 1932 when quite young he became ill. wrote letter to recommend 'brownie' only 27 years. name knorr. showed confidence in him.
	- Also wrote letter to Knorr to show confidence in him "Anybody devoted to the lord and having his spirit can accomplish his spirit."
- Lesson: when taking on different role, cope how?
- Need to keep training younger men.
- Reassigned to another place....what would happen? if everything would break down means you havent trained anyone. If you can be reassigned and everything continues as though you were never there, means you did your job. strengthened jahs organization.
- 1 pe 5:5 - clothe selves with humility
