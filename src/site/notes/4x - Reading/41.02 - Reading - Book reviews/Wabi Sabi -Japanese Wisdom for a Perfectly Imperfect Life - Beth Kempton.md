### Summary
- I really enjoyed this book. It was informative, but also the kind and considerate approach that the author takes made the book very refreshing to read. 
- Wabisabi has no direct translation in English so it is not easy to explain it directly, but some principle ideas:
	- Wabi sabi is an intuitive response to beauty that reflects the true nature of life. 
	- Wabi sabi is an acceptance and appreciation of the impermanent, imperfect and incomplete nature of everything. 
	- Wabi sabi is a recognition of the gifts of simple, slow and natural living.

## Sen no Rikyu and the tea ceremony
- Some of this was because of the influence of [[1x - References/11.05 - References - Persons/Sen no Rikyū|Sen no Rikyū]]
- In the 16th century, the tea ceremony had become a way to show off the wealth of the rich with expensive, imported from Chinea stuff
- Sen no Rikyū was the team master of Hideyoshi (samurai and daimyo or feudal lord who rose to de facto power in japan).
- He quietly changed teh tea room to be very simple and include only what was absolutely necessary: space to gather, a kettle, basic implements so that the host and guests could focus on the ceremony and each others company
- He used very simple implements and basic decorations. The bowls were made by a tilemaker.
- He singlehandled changed the culture to simple ascetic beauty
