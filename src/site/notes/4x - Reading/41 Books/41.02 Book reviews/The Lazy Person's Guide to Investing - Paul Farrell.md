### Summary
- Some ideas for investing that don't require too much work. Essentially he suggests investing in index funds. The principle is sound, but a few caveats. One is that it is a strongly USA- centered book. Secondly, the idea presented in the first chapter is to invest simply, and the rest of the book is thus rendered unnecessary.

### How I discovered it
- Some books recommended by [[4x - Reading/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/Your money or your life - Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin\|Your money or your life - Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin]]

### How the book changed me
- It doesn't really apply to the Kenyan context, but a few underlying principles are useful. Don't make your investing overly complex. Invest regularly and consistently, and don't try to beat the stock market.
