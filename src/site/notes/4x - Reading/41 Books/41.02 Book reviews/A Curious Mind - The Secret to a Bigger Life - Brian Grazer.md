### Summary
- The value of curiousity in life, especially in being curious about people. A lot of name-dropping, but the underlying principle is sound.

### How the book changed me
- I loved the idea of deliberately cultivated 'curiosity conversations'. These are conversations planned and arrnaged for with people from all different walks of life, with no ulterior purpose apart from curiosity. I definitely plan to implement this.
