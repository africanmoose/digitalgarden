### How I discovered it
- Bill Gates recommended Vacliv Smil and his book [[4x - Reading/41 Books/41.01 Book Notes/How the world works - Vacliv Smil\|How the world works - Vacliv Smil]] which i enjoyed so much and learned so much that I looked up the other books written by him.

### How the book changed me
- I learned a lot about oil, and gained a new appreciation for this versatile liquid that drives most of the world around me.

### Details
- One of the primary ways oil has changed the world is by its effect on transport: [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/A brief history of the petrol engine\|A brief history of the petrol engine]] and [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/A brief history of the diesel engine\|A brief history of the diesel engine]]
