### Summary
- Various unrelated essays that had a lot of interesting and useful applications
- The thoughts in this book are not necessarily connected to each other, so it doesn't necessarily have a direct theme
- I do recommend it because a lot of the ideas are genuinely useful (maybe not necessarily 'change your life') but definitely lots of thought provoking ideas
