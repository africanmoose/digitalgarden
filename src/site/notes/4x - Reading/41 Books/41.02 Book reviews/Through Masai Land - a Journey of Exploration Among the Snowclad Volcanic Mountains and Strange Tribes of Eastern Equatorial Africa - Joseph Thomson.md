### Summary
- This book was written by British explorer Joseph Thompson about his trips in East Africa around 1883-1884. It is a fascinating glimpse of life in my home country more than 140 years ago.
### How the book changed me
- I learned a lot about my home, as well as the people and traditions that many to this day still follow.

### Details
- Thomson was an incredible artist, and his renderings of places i know well but from 140 years ago are clearly recognisable.
- The history of bribes: "Next day we rounded the Bura mountain, by a precipitous and rugged pathway along the mountain side. We here found the " hongo" (or, as it is here called, " fingo ") system of extorting black mail developed in a most annoying manner. The ruling elder of every village passed demanded his tribute with so much boldness and arrogance."
- Majority of the place names in Kenya were given by the Masai: 
	- Gilgil - Giligili
	- Ol Donyo Longonot - Mt Longonot
	- Kileleshwa - after a silvery leaved bush named 'Leleshwa'
- On a couple of occasions, there were locations that seemingly had no local names and Thomson named them:
	- "Under the circumstances, I think I am warranted in applying a name to the mountains as a range, and I have therefore designated it the Aberdare Range, in honour of the President of the Society which despatched me to those lands."
	- "After photographing the falls, and naming them the "Thomson Falls," I proceeded through the forest in the hope of shooting something."
	- There is also a gazelle named after him 'Thomson Gazelle'. There is a picture in the book with the name, but no explanation of who gave the name.
- He details a lot of information (and drawings) of the different practices and dress of the various tribes. 
- The Masai were feared warriors, not just by the other tribes, but also by the arab traders and the white explorers. They knew they had superior courage and fighting prowess and acted accordingly.
