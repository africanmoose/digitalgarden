### Summary
- Axe argues that even little children have an innate sense of when something was designed by someone else and when it is due to random chance. And the incredible detail and range that we see in biology has the unmistakeable mark so something designed.

### How the book changed me
- This one is more of reinforcing existing beliefs.
- I like the observation that in the current scientific atmosphere, it is almost taboo to question evolution. And yet, science it meant to be all about questioning beliefs and ideas to match existing facts
