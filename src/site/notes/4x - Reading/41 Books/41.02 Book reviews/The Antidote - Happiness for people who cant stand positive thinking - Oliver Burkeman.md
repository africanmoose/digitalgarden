### Summary
- He explores the general idea that if you deliberately pursue happiness as a goal, you tend not to achieve it. Happiness is more a side effect of other actions.

### How I discovered it
- I really enjoyed Oliver Burkemans other book [[4x - Reading/41 Books/41.01 Book Notes/Time management for mortals - Oliver Burkeman\|Time management for mortals - Oliver Burkeman]], so this was a natural progression.

### How the book changed me
- The basic lesson here is that if you just do what the bible says, you will be happy. A lot of dead ends and fruitless pursuit of happiness eventually comes back to the same conclusion. Things like financial and physical security do not bring happiness. Just having a 'positive atttitude' does not automatically get us ahead. On the other hand, having a hope for the future, helping others and enjoying good relations with our neighbours does.
