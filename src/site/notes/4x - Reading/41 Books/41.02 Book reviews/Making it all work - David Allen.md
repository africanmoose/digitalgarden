### Summary
- An expansion of David Allens ideas from Getting Things Done, with more examples and explanations. Getting Things Done was a seminal book in productivity circles, but I am not sure that Making it all work moves the needle much from there.

### How I discovered it
- I read his book 'Getting Things Done' which was a game changer for me, maybe 10 years ago. I just recently discovered that there was a 'sequel' so I wanted to read it to.

### How the book changed me
- It hasn't had much impact on me, except perhaps to show me how much I have actually adapted the GTD system to my own life. I thought I was using GTD, but I realise I have changed it quite a lot to my own needs, and incorporated other systems as well.
