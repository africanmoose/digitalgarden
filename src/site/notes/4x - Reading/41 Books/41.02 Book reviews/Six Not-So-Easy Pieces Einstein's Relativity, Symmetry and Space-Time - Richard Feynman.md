### Summary
- After reading and enjoying Feynmans' six easy pieces in physics, I thought I was ready for the next step. Well, these are genuinely difficult pieces - vectors, symmetry, general relativity, energy, momentum and space-time

### How I discovered it
- From Feynmans six easy pieces

### How the book changed me
- First it was humbling: Physics is super complex and difficult to understand
- Secondly it has piqued my interested to delve a bit deeper into a few concepts that I would like to understand a bit better.

### Details
- Sadly I was just trying to keep my head above water I did not note down much. This book will have to reprocessed in future.
