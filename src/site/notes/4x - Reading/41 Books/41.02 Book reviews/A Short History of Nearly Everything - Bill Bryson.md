![A Short History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson.jpg](/img/user/4x%20-%20Reading/41%20Books/41.02%20Book%20reviews/A%20Short%20History%20of%20Nearly%20Everything%20-%20Bill%20Bryson.jpg)
### Summary
- I have read this book several times. It is a beautiful overview of the basis for a lot of modern scientific thought, along with a dose of humor and wonder that Bryson does so well.
- The main thing I dislike about this book is that after citing facts that point towards creation, he ends it by saying it is evolution.

### How I discovered it
- I have always loved Bill Bryson's travel books and so I pretty much read everything he writes

### How the book changed me
- It has made me really appreciate the world around me: the earth and all its wonder and delight, animals, insects, the cell. Pretty much everything is more wonderful than we can even imagine.
