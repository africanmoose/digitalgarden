### Summary
- A nice overview of [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Zettelkasten Method\|Zettelkasten Method]] for taking notes. Ahrens takes the time to explain things from a high level point of view rather than a specific implememtation. If you are interested in Zettelkasten notes, this is a highly recommended read.

### How I discovered it
- As part of my research and implementation of the Zettelkasten Method

### How the book changed me
- Most of the methods I had already implemented, but it has reinforced my belief in Zettelkasten notetaking methods.
