### Summary
- A collection of brief descriptions of the various rituals of writers, artists and musicians. They are all so different and yet so fascinating.

### How the book changed me

- And secondly, walking (especially in nature) and talking to others are guaranteed ways to spark creativity. Make them part of your daily routine.
