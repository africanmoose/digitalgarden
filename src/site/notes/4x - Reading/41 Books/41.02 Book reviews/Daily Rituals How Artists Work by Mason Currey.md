### Summary
- A collection of brief descriptions of the various rituals of writers, artists and musicians. They are all so different and yet so fascinating.

### How I discovered it
- No idea

### How the book changed me
- In spite of the huge variety of daily rituals, a couple lessons stood out for me: You can vary your ritual depending on your taste and situation, but you must have one. 
- And secondly, walking (especially in nature) and talking to others are guaranteed ways to spark creativity. Make them part of your daily routine.
