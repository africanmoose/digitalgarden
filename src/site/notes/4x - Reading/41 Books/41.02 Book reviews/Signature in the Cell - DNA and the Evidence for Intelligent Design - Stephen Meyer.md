### Summary
- Similar to 'Darwin's Black Box', the idea is that it is impossible for certain mechanism's to come about by chance or by evolution. One of those mechanisms is DNA contained within our cells. 

### How I discovered it
- Goodreads recommendation

### How the book changed me
- I can't say it changed my opinion of evolution, but it certainly strengthened my belief in creation. The complexity in our bodies and the universe makes it impossible for any of this to have happened by chance.

- I thought his reasoning was valid about the belief that scientists put in evolution adn the stigma attached to 'intelligent design'. As someone else has said, most people but blind faith in evolution even though they are not scientists, and possibly have never seen a fossil in their lives. What do they base their belief on? The word of their 'priests', scientists. Not many research for themselves to try to understand the truth.
- Another interesting thought he puts forth is that humans instinctively recognize when something has been built or designed. Even children have this ability. Evolutionists themselves find rocks that have been chipped off to form a point and say that this is a sign of humans using tools. And yet the vastly more complex universe, life and DNA came about by chance?
