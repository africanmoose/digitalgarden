### Summary
- Rick Rubin has coaxed music out of a bewildering array of artists: RunDMC, LL Cool J, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Weezer, Aerosmith, Johnny Cash. After reading his manual for creativity I understand why - he encourages creativity in others rather than trying to give his own ideas. A must read for any creative.

### How the book changed me
- It has encouraged me to systemize and maximize creativity. To always be on the lookout for creative solutions. To feed my creativity by being observant especially of nature
