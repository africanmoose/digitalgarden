### Summary
- A short and concise guide to how our memory works

### How I discovered it
- I have followed his [website](https://scotthyoung.com/) for a while especially his attempts to learn complex subjects like an MIT course in theoretical physics in a short period of time. He offers this book and a few others for free on the site.

### How the book changed me
- My memory is pretty rubbish for most things except maybe cars and cameras. This book helped me see some things i could to to improve for things i actually want to remember.
