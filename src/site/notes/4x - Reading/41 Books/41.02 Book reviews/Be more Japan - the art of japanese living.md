### Summary
- This is a coffee table style book with lots of beautiful pictures rather than an in depth look at Japan. Yet it manages to whet my appetite for visiting this unique country.

### Details
- Some of the areas that I would love to visit one day:
	- Traditional japanese architecture
	- I have always admired Japanese gardens
	- ceramics
	- calligraphy
- I discovered Japanese pop music and how incredibly huge they are
- I need to learn more about japanese food: sushi, sashimi, noodles, japanese whiskey
- How the Japanese manage to mix up timeless traditions with cutting edge technology.
