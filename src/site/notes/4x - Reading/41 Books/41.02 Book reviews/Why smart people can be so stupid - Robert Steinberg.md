### Summary
- A highly scientific look at what it says on the package. But how do you definte 'smart'? and how do you define 'stupid things?'. It gets tricky to analyse this strictly from a scientific point of view.

### How I discovered it
- I recently did a really stupid thing. I am not saying I am smart, but I wanted to understand why people in general do things which are clearly stupid.

### How the book changed me
- It had some interesting points: praising effort instead of natural ability. And if emphasized having a growth mindset, being able to learn from experience rather than a fixed mindset.

- Academic and practical wisdom are not highly correlated. Being an expert necessarily means narrowing focus on one specific area.
