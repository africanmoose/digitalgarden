### Summary
- A short and concise guide to understanding the scientific principles behind self-control

### How I discovered it
- I have followed his [website](https://scotthyoung.com) for a while especially his attempts to learn complex subjects like an MIT course in theoretical physics in a short period of time. He offers this book and a few others for free on the site.

### How the book changed me
- I guess much of self-control is already taught to us from the bible, but it is interesting to see how the brain works. I plan to apply some of these techniquest to some habits i am trying to acquire
