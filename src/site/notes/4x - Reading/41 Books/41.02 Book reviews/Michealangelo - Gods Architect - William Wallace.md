### Summary
- The story of Michealangelos final decades and transformation from sculptor extraordinaire into architect extraordinaire

### How the book changed me
- I have a newfound respect for Michealangelo. Not only was he an amazing sculptor, but he was an architect, builder, engineer, designer of construction workflows and site foreman.
- Its worth learning disparate skills
- Old age can be very productive, so long as we adjust our working methods to accomodate limitations

### Details
- Michealangelo left a huge number of sketches, letters and other documentation, so a lot is known about him
- He was the first Western artist to have a bioography published while he was still alive
- Though he didnt think he was an artist, his sistine Chapel fresco is considered to be one of the great works of art
- A rival, Bramante, convinced the pope to commission the Sistine Chapel, thinking that this would ruin his reputation since Michealangelo was not familiar with painting
- At the age of 71, he became the chief architect of St Peters basilica in Rome and revolutionised construction at the site. He also strengthened the design to be able to hold the weight of the dome that he designed, though it was built after his death.
