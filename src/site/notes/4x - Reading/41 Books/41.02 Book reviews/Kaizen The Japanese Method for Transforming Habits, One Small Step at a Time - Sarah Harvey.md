### Summary
- A book about the Japanese idea of continuous improvement rather than a huge radical change all at once. Harvey applies to to all aspects of ones life, and really it is a practical method of instituting change in ones life.

### How I discovered it
- I have been interested in Agile work processes from CD work, and Kaizen is wrapped up in the Agile method, so I made a point of searching for books specifically about Kaizen

### How the book changed me
- I intend to broaden Kaizen in my life from just in my work to really all aspects of life.
