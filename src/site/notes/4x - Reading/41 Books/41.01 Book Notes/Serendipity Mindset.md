Serendipity Mindset
Types of Serendipity
- Archimedes seredipity - an unexpected way to solve the problem we wanted to solve
- Post-it note serendipity - an unexpected solution to a different problem from the one you wanted to solve
- Thunderbolt Serendipity - an effortless solution to an unexpected or unrealized problem
- allow for a broader search field. ambiguity is often teh wellspring for real imagination and originality.
- look for 'positive deviance' - edge cases or extreme cases that have something good or positive as inspiration for ideas
- innovation, step changes in thinking often come from more organic, semi-structured approaches
- instead of asking 'what do you do' ask 'waht book are you reading at the moment' or 'what did you find most interesting about....'
- Instead of asking for data and details, ask about experiences unique to the person youâ€™re talking
- if you believe in total control, you wont ask for help in situations where you are not able to do something. if someone else does something wrong, they are part fo the problem. in contrast , if you accept imprefection then if something unexpected happens, you will be ok with it.
- when under stress, we fall to the level of your training rather than rise to level of expectiation. thus, avoid stress, be relaxed.
- train your extroversion muscle. Greet people in lines
- when you meet someone, cast multiple hooks as potential serendipity triggers. e.g. instead of 'i am computer worker' i do IT as a volunteer for JW and also teach bible in free time and play guitar
- set many tiny serendipity bombs e.g. email those you admire.
