### Summary
- A brief history of 6 drinks that had an outsize influence on the history of mankind: beer, wine, distilled spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-cola

### How I discovered it
- Quoted in [[4x - Reading/41 Books/41.02 Book reviews/This is your mind on plants - Michael Pollen\|This is your mind on plants - Michael Pollen]], and it has a pretty intriguing title.

### How the book changed me
- I have a much greater appreciation for beer, wine and spirits...and an appreciation for how tea and coffee have spread over the world, and the influence they have had

### Details
- What came first: bread or beer? It seems that they both came from gruel. A think gruel could be baked to be bread, and a thin gruel left to ferment would be beer.

- Tea was safer to drink because the water was boiled, even though they at the time did not understand why, it was credited with improving the health of those who drank it. Furthermore, it contains phenolics which can kill bacteria, making it even safer. It was a convenient water purification technology.

- The legacy of tea: the indepence of America and the decilne of China. Due to wisespread resentment from the colony America against taxes levied on tea, it led to the Boston tea party and ultimately independence from Britain. And Britain pushed opium on to China that directly led to its decline in order to trade tea.
