### Summary
- This is the story of how 2 men decoded the Rosetta stone - and thus came to understand how to read hieroglyphics. It is surprisingly gripping, and ties in with bible history. Strongly recommended.
- The two men were both geniuses, but totally different characters. Thomas Young was a British polymath and Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion loved everything to do with Egypt.
### How I discovered it
- Recommended by Kerry. Thanks, Kerry!

### How the book changed me
- I learned a lot about Egyptian culture, and hieroglyphs, and how hard archaeology is. It is a fascinating text.

### Details
- 

### References
- The Rosetta stone is a stela that had 3 texts in classical greek, hieroglyphs and demotic that had the same message: proclaiming the glory of King Ptolemy V in 196BCE.
