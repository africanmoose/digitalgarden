### Summary
- Jeff Hawkins, found of palm pilot and later on founder of Numenta brain research institute, lays out his idea, findings and theories about how the brian works, how AI might work, and what that might mean for the future of humanity.

### How I discovered it
- Bill Gates recommended reading

### How the book changed me
- I appreciate even more how complex our body is, and especially what an amazing organ the brain is. How a small organ has the computing power it does, and how little we understand of it.
- One detail I dislike about this book is that at the end of the day, Hawkins ideas on how the brain works are as yet unproved theories. And of course i know little about the science involved. He tends to present them as fait accompli. As he does evolution, and his ideas about why the brain ended up as it did.
