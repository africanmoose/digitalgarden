### Summary
- This is a thought-provoking book (and so it should be with the title 'clear thinking') about how to think better especially in business situations, and how to avoid poor thinking and biases.

### How I discovered it
- I have followed fs.blog from when it just started and always loved its deep thoughts and well researched articles. Getting the book was a no brainer.

### How the book changed me
- Sooo much to process from this book. It is going to take a while to integrate all the lessons learned into my life, but it is a work in progress.
- This wasn't from the book, but from fs.blog - it introduced me to Charlie Munger vast well of wisdom.
