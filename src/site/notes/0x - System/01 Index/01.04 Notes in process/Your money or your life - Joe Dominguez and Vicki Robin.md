### Summary
- This is an older book, but has lots of excellent principles on how to think about money, savings, and how to run our finances.

### How I discovered it
- I followed the simple dollar blog for years, and the writer at the time (Trent Hamm) always swore by it. Now I finally got around to reading it I understand why.

### How the book changed me
- We will see how it changes me in the long run, but really this book has a big impact on how I view money and finances. I may revisit this review to add concrete changes, but I have a lot of notes in my todo list on what to do financially speaking, some mentioned below.
