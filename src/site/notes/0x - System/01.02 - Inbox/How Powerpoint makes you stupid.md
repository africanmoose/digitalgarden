## Summary
- Full title: How PowerPoint Makes You Stupid: The Faulty Causality, Sloppy Logic, Decontextualized Data, and Seductive Showmanship That Have Taken Over Our Thinking - Franck Frommer
- Mr Frommer really hates powerpoint and goes about trying to prove it. I agree with many of the things he says, but not all of it, and I am not sure that we can pin the generally dumbing down of everything on only one product. But he definitely gives me food for thought.

## How I discovered it
- I have no idea!

## How the book changed me
- I may not agree with everything he said, but I want to try and beware the tendency to reduce everything to simplified cliches
