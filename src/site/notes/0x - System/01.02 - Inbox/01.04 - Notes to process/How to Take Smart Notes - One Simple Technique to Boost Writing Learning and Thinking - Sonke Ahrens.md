### Summary
- A nice overview of [[1x - References/11.03 - References - Ideas/Zettelkasten Method\|Zettelkasten Method]] for taking notes.

### How I discovered it
- As part of my research and implementation of the Zettelkasten Method

### How the book changed me
- Most of the methods I had already implemented, but it has reinforced my belief in Zettelkasten notetaking methods.
