### Summary
- A collection of brief descriptions of the various rituals of writers, artists and musicians. They are all so different and yet so fascinating.

### How I discovered it
- No idea

### How the book changed me
- In spite of the huge variety of daily rituals, a couple lessons stood out for me: You can vary your ritual depending on your taste and situation, but you must have one. And secondly, walking (especially in nature) and talking to others are guaranteed ways to spark creativity. Mark them part of your daily routine.
