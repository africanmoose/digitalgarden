### Summary
- Our time puts a lot of emphasis on experts. While valuable, we should not completely hand them the keys to major decisions in our life, but instead see them as a value resource, not a decision making device.
- As we face increasingly complex problems, siloed thinking and overly tight thinking becomes a disadvantage, similar to the 6 blind men encountering and elephant. Each has an accurate but wrong view of what is an elephant and only having an overview helps to put all the pieces together.

### How I discovered it
- Not sure actually

### How the book changed me
- This book has made clear what I always suspected - that while a valuable resource, we should not delegate all power to experts (including the internet!) Also there is increible power in having a good general knowlege of many things.
