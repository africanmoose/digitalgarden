### Summary
- Our income derives from our relationships - with our boss, with our coworkers, with our customers.

### Details
- If we have many friends, we help each other with things like moving house or borrowing tools or tapping into each others skill sets. The fewer greinds we have, the more we have to pay someone to do these services.
- Our friends have to be real friends for this to work.
- Open up to others, spend time with people, show hospitality, keep in touch, help freely, ask for advice and show appreciation
- Relationship means something of positive value is exchanged on a regular basis - advice, help, loan, ear to listen etc and minimum of negative exchanges.
