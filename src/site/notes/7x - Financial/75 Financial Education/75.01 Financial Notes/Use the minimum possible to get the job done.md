### Summary
- Experiment with what is the minimum possible to accomplish something. Then set that as the new baseline

### Details
- We may have a habit of using 2 or 3 serviettes to clean something up, whereas in reality only one is needed. We may squeeze a lot of toothpaste out, or a huge squirt of cleaning up liquid, or shampoo. 
- Better to experiment with that is the minimum required to do the job well.

### References
- Simple dollar (now offline)

### Quotes
- What I’ve found is this: **you’d be _shocked_ how much less you can use during a day without sacrificing any quality.** There are so many disposable and consumable things that we use in our lives, even if we’re careful about it. Taking the time to “reset” our expectations on how much we have to use can pay great dividends – not only are we directly saving money by consuming less (and thus not having to replace these consumables as often), we’re also changing our expectations.
