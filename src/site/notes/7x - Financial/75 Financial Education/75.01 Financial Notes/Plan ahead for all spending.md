### Summary
- We plan ahead for big purchases and view it as normal and reasonable. But for small purchases, if we do the same planning, even a few minutes research can save a lot of money

### Details
- Small items such a clothing or a meal out can be bought spontaneously, btu the emounts can increase rapidly without us realising it. Even small amounts can be planned.
- We dont have to plan for every shilling, but we can plan a 'sponteanous purchase' fund every month.

### Quotes
- "every action you take is worthy of a bit of thought, either beforehand, in the moment, or afterwards. A bit of reflection often tells you whether that choice was right or wrong for you – whether it actually adds value to your life."
