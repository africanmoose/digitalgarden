### assigning work
-5Ws and H

- orders: no room for guesswork, used only for emergency

    - more freedom
    - employee choose task
    - low priority task
- collaborative approach
    - team has a meeting
    - team establish objectives
    - most effective method, esp for mature team

### degrees of delegation
- delegation not giving power away
- levels
    - complete supervision: dangerous task, employee not familiar, has financial or legal implications
    - partial supervision: good balance, supervisor monitors work, encourages growth by adding more levels of complexity
    - complete independence: updates are important, employee does the task on their own

### implementing delegation
- delegating effectively allows to expand work able to deliver
- decide to delegate
    - help others grow: task should provide opportunity for growth
    - some critical tasks may not be delegated
- to whom to delegate?
    - skills of employee, knowlege, attitidue
    - do they need training? do we have resources? what is their work style? what are tehir long term goals
    - what is their current workload?
    - may take longer for them to complete the task than you do. be patient
-provide instructions
    - explain what is needed. let them know how much updates
    - goals
    - progress updates - agree on when feedback should be given.
    - ask them to give a summary
    - let them know you are available for feedback
- not micromanage, but also monitor and support to make sure job is done correctly
    - hold delegates to schedules
    - ask for progress report
    - help remove barriers impeding their taks
    - only accept good quality work
    - recognize and reward effort
- troubleshooting
    - delegate keeps coming with questions. they should not rely on you too much. show them how to find answers. ask them for recomendations when they have a problem. maybe they are not ready - ask seniour employee to assist
    - another team member performing the task. talk to the delegate. suggest alternate resources.
    - end result not what you expected. is it done incorrectly or just not how i would have done it. were orginail instructions incorrect?


### provide feeback
- feedback should be specific, timely, expressed directly, behaviour focused, actionable, helpful (STEBAH)
- methods: direct praise or criticism (direct critisicm very unusual)
- feedback sandwich (praise....criticism....praise) problem is that people expect teh criticism
- open faced sandwich (praise....criticism).
- 360 degree: feedback from all groups they interact with:
- informal feedback: most often, quick and precise, through any media. not in front of group
- formal feedback: documentation to identify strenghts and weaknesses. give plenty of notice, focused on long term.
