### Summary
- Many think of everything in terms of money. But really money just represents our time/energy.

### Details
- Joe Dominguez/Vicki Robin use the term 'life energy' to represent the hours of life we have that we trade for money.
- Even gambling or getting an inheritance require trading some life energy since they involve some work to access.
- our life energy is tangible and finite, limited and irretrievable.
