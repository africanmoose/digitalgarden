### Quotes
The problems with clutter:
* stuff weighs you down * stuff stresses you out * stuff is expensive, to buy, store and maintain
* looking for stuff in clutter leads to wasted time
* clutter is a reflection of your internal state
You accumulate clutter by being in the mindset of Acquiring rather than a mindset of Enough. You accumulate it by having a fear mentality, not wanting to let go of things, wanting to hoard and keep everything for sentimental reasons.
Being too busy also leads to clutter, because we don't have time to clean up, don't have time to get rid of the unnecessary, and clutter will pile up. So reducing what you do will help clear clutter
