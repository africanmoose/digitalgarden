### Summary
- When we are aksed 'what do you do?', we reply, 'I am a plumber.' Not 'i do plumbing' or I am a husband, son, friend, etc.

### Details
- our clothes, transport, food, lifestyle all are designed to reflect our position in the world of work.
- So it is natural to take our identity from our job. 
- But is it really correct that our entire identity comes from a job?
