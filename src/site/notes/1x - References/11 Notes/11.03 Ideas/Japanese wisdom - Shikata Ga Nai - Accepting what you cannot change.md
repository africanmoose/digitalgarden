### Summary
- Thi is a concept that means 'It Cannot be Helped' - accept things that we cannot change and focussing on what we can change.

### Details

- We stop trying to change people to be what we want them to be, leading to frustration from both us and them
- Focus instead on what we can change: our selves, our attitude and our thoughts
