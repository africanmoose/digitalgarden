### Summary
- We feel more pain at loss than joy at gain. 

### Details
- For example, we feel worse at losing $100 than the joy at gaining $100.
- Apparently emotionally a loss weighs about twice that of a similar gain.
- If you want to convince someone, dont focus on advantages, focus on how to avoid disadvantages
