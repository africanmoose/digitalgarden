### Quotes
One effective question to ask yourself before you act is, “Will this action make the future easier or harder?”[*] This surprisingly simple question helps change your perspective on the situation and avoid making things worse. As my grandfather (and many others) used to say, “If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing you need to do is stop digging.”
