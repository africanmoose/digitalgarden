### Summary
- For a hobby to have a mind-sharpening benefit, we need to pick something challenging.

### Details
- if its something we can just do automatically then it will not help us
- multicultural experiences such as travel can have cognitive benefit
- A 2014 study found that children who grow up in multicultural families outperform monocultural kids on tests that measure creativity and problem solving. The same applies to people who spend at least a few months living abroad.
- We must actively engage with other cultures to get the benefits (not just lying on the beach). Being exposed to different ideas, perspectives changes our brain
