### Summary
- variety plays an important role in learning.
- contextual interference means practicing the same skill but in different situations

### Details
- Contextual interference improves our ability to identify the problem correctly
- Putting similar situations side by side helps us compare and see teh key distinction between them.
- more difficult memory retrieval strenthens our memory more than easier retrieval. Contextual interference helps this.

### Quotes
[Contextual interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning#Structure_of_practice_and_contextual_interference) occurs when you practice the same skill, but vary the situations in which it is called for.

For instance, you could practice your tennis backhand by being served backhand shots repeatedly. Alternatively, your coach could mix things up: serve you backhand shots interspersed with balls that require a forehand shot.

Or imagine preparing for a calculus exam: you could study all the questions that require the chain rule, then all the questions that use the quotient rule. Instead, you might shuffle these questions together so you can’t be sure which technique is needed.
