### Summary
- Max Plancks chauffeur could give his lecture on quantum mechanics because he heard it so often. But did he understand it? We need to try and differentiate between real knowlege and 'chauffeur' knowlege

### Details
- News anchors are actors - they dont really know deeply about the topics they discuss.
- We all have a 'circle of competence' an area wehere our understanding is deep and intuitive. This is where we have an edge. (Charli Munger)
- One clue: experts recognise the limits of what tehy know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they say 'I dont know'

### Quotes
- "After receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour across Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart: “It has to be boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it for you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur’s cap. That’d give us both a bit of variety.” Planck liked the idea, so that evening the driver held a long lecture on quantum mechanics in front of a distinguished audience. Later, a physics professor stood up with a question. The driver recoiled: “Never would I have thought that someone from such an advanced city as Munich would ask such a simple question! My chauffeur will answer it.”"
- “You have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don’t understand. It’s not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is.” Munger underscores this: “So you have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of competence.” - Charlie Munger
