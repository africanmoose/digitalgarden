### Summary
- Human memory is terrible, so we need some kind of system to record reality.
- This is especially important for when we are trying to develop habits, since our brain will twist the truth a lot.

### Details
- If we dont keep a record, our brain will alter our memory as to why or even whether we did it something
- records are ruthless, and once we start recording we start to see the truth.
- This may apply to financial activity, eating habits, exercise habits, work habits, sleeping habits
- recording even trivial things can help us bring back memories such as time you slept, etc.

### Quotes
- "Once I find an excuse that sounds right, there’s no stopping me. Unless I keep a record, my memory will be altered as to which of my reasons were actually excuses. Records are ruthless. I’ve written over and over in my diary that I thought I was only going to drink one glass of liquor, but once I did, I couldn’t stop. In keeping and reviewing records, the disadvantages finally sink in. It was an impossible dream for me to drink just one glass."
