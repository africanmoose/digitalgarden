### Summary
- To learn, you must get surprised, and the best way to do this is to move to a place totally unlike what we already know.

### Details
- We are only learning new things if we are being surprised. see [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.03 Ideas/Information is only information if it is Surprising\|Information is only information if it is Surprising]]
- The best way to engender surprise is to move to a totally different place. Even simple things like shopping become learning experiences.
- When you move, immerse yourself in the new place.

### Quotes
- "Every country has a shared and working philosophy. Dive in and really try to understand it. This is one of the best things you can do for your brain. Stay immersed at least until you feel yourself saying “we” instead of “they.”
- "Then, if you want to keep your brain actively learning and growing forever, keep moving across the world and immersing yourself like this for the rest of your life."
