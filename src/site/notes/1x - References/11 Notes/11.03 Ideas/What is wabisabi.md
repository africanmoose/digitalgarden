### Summary
- It is difficult to define this idea in English but it incorporates the ideas of impermanence, asymmetry and imperfection
- The Japanese words have changed meaning over time

### Details
- It is an aesthetic idea that comes from the flow of nature: everything is in a constant state of change.
- Since everything is changing, it is never 'perfect' but every moment has its beauty
- Random flaws and imperfections have a certain beauty.
- Qualities such as impermanence, humility, asymmetry and imperfection are the principles of wabisabi (as opposed to greek classical beauty which is permanence, grandeur, symmetry and perfection)

### Quotes
- "Like a great many other words that are descriptive of emotions and ideologies, the words wabi and sabi have travelled through a millenium of cultural change and in so doing have collected a vast amount of cultural baggage. As usage and intended meanings change, the complexity and depth of words can increase exponentially....Words are like living organisms, they evolve to match the expressive requirements of those using a language."
