### Quotes
- "Even the simplest [cells] are far beyond the limits of human ingeniuty"
- "In ways that we have barely begun to understand, trillions upon trillions of reflexive chemical reactions add up to a mobile, thinking, decision-making you - or come that that, a rather less reflective, but still incredibly organized dung beetle. Ever living thing, never forget, is a wonder of atomic engineering."
