### Quotes
- "So, how can we dodge the self-serving bias? Do you have friends who tell you the truthâ€”no holds barred? If so, consider yourself lucky. If not, do you have at least one enemy? Good. Invite him or her over for coffee and ask for an honest opinion about your strengths and weaknesses. You will be forever grateful you did."
