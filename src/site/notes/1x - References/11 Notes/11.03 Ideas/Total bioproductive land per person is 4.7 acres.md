### Quotes
Ecological Overshoot of the Human Economy,4 states that there are 28.2 billion acres of bioproductive land on Earth — the total surface area minus the deep oceans, deserts, icecaps and built-up land.When divided between six billion people, each person gets a 4.7-acre share —we'll call this area each person's “personal planetoid.”
