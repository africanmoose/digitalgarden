### Summary
- Dont be tied to the familiar or traditional way of doing something

### Details
- Forget any previous judgements of price, age, social status, etc.
- View things as they are in nature - trees, sunset, etc
- Focus on tiny details that invoke a sense of wonder: a tiny bloom, a hidden view
- If we are decorating, dont display everything at once
- If we are talking dont say everything at once, or fill every pause with speech.
- Leave something unfinished to draw teh user in
- Beauty can arise in the simplest of things - a conversation, a walk
