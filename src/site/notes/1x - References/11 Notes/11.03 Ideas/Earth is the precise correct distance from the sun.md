### Summary
- We are the precise distance from the sun to allow us to exist.
- The sun is the precise correct type of star to allow us to live in orbit around it

### Details
- The sun is big enough to give off enough energy, but not too big that it would bunr out after a short time.
- If we were too close to the sun all the water would boil away
- If we were a bit farther away everything would freeze
- An astrophysicist named Micheal Hart concluded that if earth was just 1% farther awayor 5% closer we could not exist.
