### Quotes
- "We are not supposed to be flawless and uniform, as if we have come out of a peoplefactory. What if you imagined yourself as a beautiful hand-crafted pot, lovingly shaped and appreciated because of, not in spite of, your imperfections? What if you acknowledged that texture, character and depth are what underlie your natural beauty, inside and out? And what if you recognised how all that has shaped you along the way has made you who you are today?"
