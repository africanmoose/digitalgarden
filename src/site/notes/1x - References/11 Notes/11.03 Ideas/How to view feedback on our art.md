### Summary
- Feedback from someone on our art tells us more about them than the art, since everyone has a unique vision.

### Details
- Occasionally, a comment will resonate with us, and we will find something in which we can improve.
- Sometimes the comment may hurt us. At this moment, we should not be discouraged or give up, but take it in a neutral way and engage in our art in a new way. Maybe we agree and change, or maybe we hold more firmly to our original idea
