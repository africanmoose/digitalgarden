### Quotes
- "Perhaps you think that you can know what it’s like to have a child, even though you’ve never had one, because you can read or listen to the testimony of what it was like for others,” writes the Yale University professor of philosophy L. A. Paul. “You are wrong.”
	It is, she writes, “an epistemically unique” experience. Meaning: You don’t know shit"
