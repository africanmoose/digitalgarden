### Summary
- Get feedback from others, then use it to change. Don't take pride in an area of ignorancel.

### Details
- When we have a strength: focus on it to produce results.
- Where we need to improve: either skills, or knowlege, work on filling it.
- 'Intellectual arrogance' can prevent us from growth. For example, an engineer may be proud of not taking people into consideration, or an artist proud that they don't know anything about machines.  This is self-defeating. Work on acquiring the skills we need.
- We may not need to become an expert in our area of ignorance, but we can at least have a general idea of where we should be.
