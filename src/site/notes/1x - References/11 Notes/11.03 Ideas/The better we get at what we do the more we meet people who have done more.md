### Quotes
- "The better we get at what we do, the more exposure we get to people who have done more, are ‘further ahead’, have more ‘success’. But as soon as we take our eyes off our own path and get lost in theirs, we miss the very experience of our own journey. It’s like being on a train, travelling through a foreign country you have always wanted to visit, and then spending the whole trip watching a film on your laptop. You miss the point, and you miss the adventure."
