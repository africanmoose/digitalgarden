### Summary
- Like pilots or others in high stress jobs, there is value to prethinking a potential situation and writing down the steps do do if it happens. THen in as stressful situation we already know what to do.

### Details
- Jack Stuster is a scientist who has degrees in psychology and anthropology, specifically in understanding what humans do in high-stress environments like space stations or the antartic.
- He recommends writing out instruction manuals for when something out of the ordinary happens. The instructions are not high level - more of 'look at the panel, if there is a a green light do A, if there is a red light do B'
- If prethought we can trust the system to guide us when because of stress or tiredness we cannot think it through ourselves
- The principle works for work planning and writing out the next action for our projects
