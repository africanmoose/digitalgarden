### Summary
- In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram performed a series of experiments showing that people often obey authority even when what they are being ordered to do is unethical or harmful to others

### Details
- The experiments involved administering an electric shock to a fake learner in the name of helping him learn. The participants were told it was an experiment on memory and learning. An instructor instructs the participant to administer higher and higher shocks even though the participant can see and hear the pain of the learner.
- 65% of participants were obedient and gave the maximum possible voltage.
