### Summary
- It is hard for us to see absolute values - we need a comparison in order to correctly judge something.

### Details
- We judge beauty, price or size only in contrast to an anchor.
- Car showrooms do this by selling a 3000$ stereo because you already paid 50,000$ for the car....but ordinarily you would not spend that much money on a stereo.
