### Quotes
For example, have you ever smelled something that triggered a memory of a specific time
or place? Perhaps you couldn’t even name the aroma, but a vivid scene from days gone by flashed in your mind’s eye: a day spent at Coney Island, bath time as a child, the forest behind your parents’ house. This phenomenon is not a fluke. Aroma and memory in particular are closely linked—and it has to do with the anatomy we’ve discussed before. Recall that aroma is first processed by our olfactory bulb, which is a part of our forebrain. The olfactory system is the only sensory system that sends information directly to the forebrain. The information is then sent quickly to the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus, which are responsible for memories and emotions.

Scientists believe that this more direct route makes aroma more deeply intertwined with memory. All the other senses go to the thalamus, the relay station deep in the center of the brain, for processing first; aroma bypasses it.
