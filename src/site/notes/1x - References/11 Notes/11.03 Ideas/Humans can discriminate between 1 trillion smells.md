### Quotes
Mammals tend to have well-developed olfaction systems, particularly when it comes to
discriminating different smells. We humans can discriminate—that is, detect differences between—at least one trillion odor stimuli. That means we can discriminate more odors than colors (2.3 to 7.5 million) and sound tones (340,000).3 People used to think that humans’ sense of smell was inferior to that of other mammals, such as dogs and mice, since we have relatively few olfactory receptors in comparison. New research has shown that we have quite an advanced olfaction system and outperform many mammals, including dogs, with our sensitivity to tested odor stimuli—which are called odorants—and are on par with or only slightly worse at discriminating tested odorants
