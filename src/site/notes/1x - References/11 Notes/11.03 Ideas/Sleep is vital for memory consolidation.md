### Summary
- During sleep our brain takes what has been learned during the day and make them permanent through a process known as consolidation

### Details
- Naps protect our memory from decay.
- We need at least a full 90min cycle to consolidate our memory, so either have a full 90min nap, or study new things before we sleep
