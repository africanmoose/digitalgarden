### Summary
- By not explicitly stating everything, you allow the reader to fill in the gaps and become a participant in the art

### Details
- Japanese short poems, especially Haiku, are very brief and dont give all teh details of the scene.
- This allows the reader to actively participate by filling in the meaning and become an active participant in the creative process.
