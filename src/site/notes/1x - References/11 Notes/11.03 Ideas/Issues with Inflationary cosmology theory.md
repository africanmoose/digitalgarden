### Summary
- Inflationary cosmology theory is the idea that there are infinite universes (either parallel, or contained within bubbles). The theory is that if there are infinite universes, then anything that can exist, does exist somewhere

### Details
- It can supposedly explain any event no matter how improbably because of the infinite possibilities.

### Quotes
- Inflationary cosmology has yet another liability: once permitted as a possible explanation for anything, it destroys practical and scientific reasoning about everything. Inflationary cosmology can explain the origin of all events, no matter how improbable, by reference to chance because of the infinite probabilistic resources it purports to generate. It follows that events we explain by reference to known causes based upon ordinary experience are just as readily explained in inflationary cosmology as chance occurrences without any causal antecedent. According to inflationary cosmology, all events consistent with our laws of nature will eventually arise as the result of random fluctuations in the quantum vacuum constituted by the inflaton field. This means that an exquisitely designed machine or an intricately crafted piece of poetry is just as likely to have been produced by chance fluctuations in the quantum vacuum as by a human being. It also means that events such as earthquakes or regular phenomena such as condensation are just as likely to have been the result of chance fluctuations in the quantum vacuum as they are to have been the result of an orderly progression of discernible material causes. In short, if inflationary cosmology is true, anything can happen for no reason at all, beyond the supposed random fluctuations in the quantum vacuum of the inflaton field.
