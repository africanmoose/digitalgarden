### Summary
- When first asked something, dont say the first thing that comes into your mnind. Give yourself time to consider a better answer

### Details
- You might look stupid in the moment, but it doesnt matter. The answer will be much better.
- Try and get questions for any interview in advance.
- Our first answer is usually outdated - either its an answer we came up with a long time ago and havent reviewed in light of recent information, or its an emotional response.
- Wait a few days before making a decision, or acting on a decision.
- the longer the wait, the smarter the answer is.
