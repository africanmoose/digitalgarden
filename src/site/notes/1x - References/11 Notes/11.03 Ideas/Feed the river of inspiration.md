### Summary
- Inspiration is like a river.  When we add to the river, the flow increases and we have more ideas, and others are inspired by us. If we hoard ideas, the river runs dry

### Details
- When we share ideas, they are replenished
- If we hold our ideas in, new ideas are slow to appear
- release ideas in the knowlege that more will arrive
- the more we share the more our skills improve
- the more we share, the more those around us are inspired, and in turn inspire us in turn.
- perfectionism can also block the rivers flow
