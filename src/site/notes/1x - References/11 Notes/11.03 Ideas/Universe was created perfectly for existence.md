### Summary
- Every 'setting' in the universe is perfect for our existence. 

### Details
- For example, if gravity was fractionally stronger or weaker, or the rate of expansion of the universe a bit slower or a bit faster, there may not have been stable elemends formed to make everything, or the universe might have collapsed 'like a badly erected tent'

### Quotes
"What is extraordinary from our point of view is how well it turned out for us. If the universe had formed just a tiny bit differently - if gravity were fractionally stronger or weker, if the expansion had proceeded just a little more slowly or swiftly - then there might never have been stable elements to make you and me and the ground we stand on. Had gravity been a trifle stronger the universe itself might have collapsed like a badly erected tent without precisely the right vales to give it the right dimensions"
