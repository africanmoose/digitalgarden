### Summary
- We use anchors to get an idea of what something should be, but often chose our anchor incorrectly

### Details
- Shops use recommended retail price as an anchor.
- sales professionals establish a price early long before an offer is made.
- better to chose your anchor before you get outside opinions. For example, decide how much you will pay for something before going shopping.
