### Quotes
"Always ask, but never expect.

Always ask for what you want. Many people are happy to helpâ€”if the request is direct and specific. In a surprising number of cases, something remarkable is possible if you have the courage to ask.

Never expect people to say yes. Everyone is busy and balancing multiple priorities. Your request is not their responsibility. When you're told no, move on lightly and freely. The world is full of opportunity."
