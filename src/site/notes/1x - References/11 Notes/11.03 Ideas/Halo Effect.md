### Summary
- We judge something based on a single outstanding aspect 

### Details
- We abscribe  success and superiority where it is not due, for example buying products because of the good reputation of the brand.
- the single aspect could be beauty, social status, age
- we automatically regard good-looking people as more pleasant, honest and intelligent. 
- teachers unconsciously give good looking students better grades
- discovered by Edward Lee Thorndike almost 100 years ago
