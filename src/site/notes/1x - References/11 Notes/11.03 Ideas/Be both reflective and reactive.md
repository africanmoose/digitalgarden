### Summary
- Being too reflective may prevent us from taking any action. Being too quick to react may prevent us from thinking out our actions. The correct way lies somewhere in the middle.

### Details
- Being too mindful could make us become stagnant.
- Being too active could make us mindless.
- We can learn from our experiences by thinking about what is happening in our lives, and then act on what we learn going forward.
