### Summary
- We need a level of stress to engage our brain. And this is provided by having a task that is difficult. But not too difficult. and not too easy

### Details
- If the difficulty level is too hard, the brain will feel it is suffering and just stop
- If too low, then the brain will not engage
- When the level is just right, cortisol (stress hormone) is released and we get a sense of satifaction.
- When we are learning something, the brian is engaged.
- Just repeating something over and over again doesnt produce results. We need to make intentional practise - focus on a particular area and consciously try to improve it.
