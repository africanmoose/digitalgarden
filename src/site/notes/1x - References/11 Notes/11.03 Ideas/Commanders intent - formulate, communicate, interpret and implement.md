### Quotes
Commander’s intent has four components: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The first two components—formulate and communicate—are the responsibility of the senior commander. You must communicate the strategy, the rationale, and the operational limits to the team. Tell them not just what to do, but why to do it, how you arrived at your decision, so they understand the context, as well as the boundaries for effective action—what is completely off the table. Subordinate commanders then have the tools for the last two components: interpreting the changing contexts and implementing the strategy in those contexts.
