### Summary
- Just as we have a contract for our work hours and so on, we could arrange a contract for family life - to ensure that we meet our family obligations

### Details
- for Neil, this includes: 4 family days a month (no phones, inlaws, etc. 4 dates nights a month. 4 nights just him alone for whatever he wants to do. if miss date nights, then marriage starts to become transactional and start to have fights and bad feelings.
- Phone: I am the master not the other way around. Thus all notifications are turned off.
