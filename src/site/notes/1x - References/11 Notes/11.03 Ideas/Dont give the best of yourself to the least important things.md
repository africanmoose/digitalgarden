### Quotes
When you step back and think about it for a second, I was giving one of
the most important things I wanted to do the worst of myself. Email, which I dread on the best of days, was getting my most energetic and creative self. Many of us do this with our partners too. By the time everything we need to do over the course of a long day is finished, weâ€™re exhausted. And this is the time we give to our spouse, the most important person in our lives! If there were a recipe for accumulated disaster, it would be giving the
best of ourselves to the least important things and the worst of ourselves to the most important things.
