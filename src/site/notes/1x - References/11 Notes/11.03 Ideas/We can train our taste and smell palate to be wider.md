### Quotes
Some studies suggest that taste preferences are learned through social practice and that the related judgments and behaviors become habitual to the point that most of us perform them unconsciously. This idea has stuck with me as I’ve written this book, likely because it confirms my own experience. Most of us don’t often have to think about our sense of taste beyond
our immediate taste preferences and judgments (“this food is delicious” or “I really don’t like this drink”). We often don’t have reason to reflect on how our tastes have or haven’t changed over the years—or how we got them in the first place. Aside from occasional congestion from colds and flus that temporarily decreases our ability to taste, our gustatory system is usually there for us. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been very few reported cases of long-term damage to this system, aside from the decreased sensitivity that comes with age or through smoking. I never thought about my palate until I started drinking coffee,
evaluating extraction in pursuit of the perfect cup, and finding joy in discovering new flavor notes in my brew. But I quickly realized two important lessons: (1) my palate was limited by my own experience and (2) I could change my palate by intentionally gathering new points of reference. It seems fairly obvious that we can intentionally train (or retrain) our
palates. Although there are very few studies on the effect of sensory training on taste acuity, the ones that exist seem to suggest that training does increase your ability to perceive and recognize tastes, but exposure and habituation alone can increase your recognition capabilities—no complicated training required.
