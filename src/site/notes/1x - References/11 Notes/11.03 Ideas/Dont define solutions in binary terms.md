### Summary
- If we frame our choice in a binary question, we limit our solutions to only 2 options and perhaps unknowingly limit ourselves from a better solution

### Details
- For example, we might ask "should i quit my job or not?" instead of "I have a difficult boss, what are different ways i can address this?"
- Consciously spent time formulating alternatives instead of framing a question as yes/no
