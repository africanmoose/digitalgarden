### Summary
- Having a reservoir of ideas allows you to develop ideas over a long period of time

### Details
- Otherwise you are limited to the size of your memory (in my case very small)
- Exceptional ideas need a longer period of time

### Quotes
> But most importantly, without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the length of a single project or the capacity of your memory. Exceptional ideas need much more than that.
