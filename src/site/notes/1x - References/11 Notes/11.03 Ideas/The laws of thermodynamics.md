### Summary
- The [zeroth law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics "Zeroth law of thermodynamics") defines [thermal equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium "Thermal equilibrium") and forms a basis for the definition of temperature: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

- The [first law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics "First law of thermodynamics") states that, when energy passes into or out of a system (as [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics) "Work (thermodynamics)"), [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat"), or [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter")), the system's [internal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy "Internal energy") changes in accordance with the law of [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy").

- The [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") states that in a natural [thermodynamic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_process "Thermodynamic process"), the sum of the [entropies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") of the interacting [thermodynamic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system "Thermodynamic system") never decreases. A common corollary of the statement is that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body.

- The [third law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics "Third law of thermodynamics") states that a system's entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero "Absolute zero"). With the exception of non-crystalline solids, the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.

### Details
- A summary by chemist P.W. Atkins: "There are four laws. The third of them, the Second Law, was recognized firt; the first, the Zeroth Law was formulated last; the First Law was second; the Third Law might not even be a Law."
- The first law - You can't create energy
- The second law - a little energy is always wasted, so there can be no perpetual motion machines.
- The third law - You can't reduce temperatures down to absolute zero...there will always be a little warmth
- A summary by Dennis Overbye: "1. You can't win 2. You can't break even. 3. You can;t get out of the game.""
