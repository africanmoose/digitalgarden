### Summary
- Orthonasal means things we smell through the nose
- Retronasal means when food we chew or swallow releases odor molecules through our throat to our nose.
- When it comes to taste, retronasal olfaction plays a large part of what we 'taste', even though its actually how we smell

### Details
- Usually we are not even aware that our sense of 'taste' is primarily smell combined with information about the feel and taste from the mouth.
- Our sense of smell is very basic: bitter, sour, sweet, salty and umami. Everything else comes from our sense of smell
- Our brain provides a huge amount of processing power just for detecting, processing and synthesizing flavours, unique among mammals

### Quotes
We, on the other hand, are optimized for retronasal olfaction. Retronasal olfaction plays the
biggest role when it comes to flavor—and this is where the human olfactory system really shines. Retronasal olfaction originates inside the mouth when we chew or swallow something and then exhale through the nose. When we swallow coffee, odor molecules are released in the mouth and travel through the back of our throats up into our noses, where they are decoded by receptors. Retronasal olfaction is such an integral part of flavor creation and eating that we usually aren’t aware of it—we think we are tasting (“I love how this tastes!”), and it seems to be happening only in our mouths, not our noses. In reality, our brains are simultaneously decoding disparate taste and tactile information from the mouth and smell information from the nose to create a detailed story that “reads” to us as a single, cohesive perception. That’s what flavor is. And it’s hard to overstate the critical role that retronasal olfaction plays in all of this. Without odorants, we’d detect only the basic tastes: bitter, sour, sweet, salty, and umami. What we think of as flavor derives largely from our sense of smell.


Remember, from a biological perspective, flavor is a tidy packet of information—some
hardwired and some learned—that tells our brain how to respond to the things we put in our mouths. The parts of our brain that engage in detecting, processing, and synthesizing flavor are vast, even when compared to other mammals, which implies it has played a critical role in our survival as a species. This aspect of our biology—the sheer amount of processing power the brain offers up for flavor—is, indeed, uniquely human. And perhaps most important for this book, our ability to articulate and appreciate flavor is uniquely human as well
