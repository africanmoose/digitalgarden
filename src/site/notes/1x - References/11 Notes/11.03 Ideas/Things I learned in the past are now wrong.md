### Summary
- Times change, so something I may have learnt in the past no longer applies

### Details
- Even if times haven't changed, maybe I have changed
- Maybe some limitations no longer exist
- Solution is deliberate unlearning. Check what we think we know. Get current proof that it is still true.
- It may require humility to admit we don't know something that used to be our area of expertise
