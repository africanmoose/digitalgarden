### Summary
- There is not much point in keeping notes instead of remembering things - everything is readily available on the internet anyway
- The process of keeping notes should embed some information in your mind so that you at least remember that you have something on the topic in your notes

### Details
- The process of putting notes into a Zettelkasten helps to solidify it in your memory
- A Zettelkasten may also bring up reminders or links to a previous note on the topic, also bolstering our memory

### Quotes
Not using your Zettelkasten as a substitute for memory may seem a contradiction, since one purpose of a Zettelkasten is to retrieve information you can't remember in the moment. But there's a big difference between using notes to jog your memory and using notes as a substitute for memory. One may think, Well you can jog your memory with internet articles. But your Zettelkasten doesn't just help jog your memory. The activities involved in managing it also help solidify your memory, so it needs less jogging in the first place.
