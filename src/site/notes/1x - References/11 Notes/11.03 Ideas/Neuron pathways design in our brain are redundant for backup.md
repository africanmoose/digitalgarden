### Summary
- Our brain design is such that nothing ever depends on a single synapse. 

### Details
- For example, a neuron might use 30 synapses to recognize a pattern. Even if 10 fail, the neuron is still able to recognize the pattern
- Similarly, the neocortex does not depend on a single cortical column. 
- When a person has a stroke or trauma that removes significant part of the brain, often the person can still function.
