### Quotes
- times of pressure: during a crisis, your people watch you with a microscope, noting every move you make. In such times, your subordinates learn a great deal about you and what you really believe, as opposed to what you say. Do you accept responsibility for your mistakes, or do you look for someone to blame? Do you support your employees, or do you turn on them? Are you cool and calm, or do you lose your temper Do you stand up for what you believe or do you take the expedient route and advocate what you think your seniors want to hear?
