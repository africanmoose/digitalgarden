### Summary
- The goal of art is not to be perfect, but to share our view of the world

### Details
- Art is sharing our view of the world, or perception of something. Maybe others already know it adn thus it resonates with us, or maybe it is a totally new view that opens our eyes to something completely new.
- Either way, it resonates with us somehow.
