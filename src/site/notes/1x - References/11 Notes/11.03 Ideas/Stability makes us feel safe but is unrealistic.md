### Summary
- Stability can feel good, but everything changes in time, so eventually we will be disrupted

### Details
- All stability is precarious
- There will be a sudden change - redundancy, loss, illness

- It is better to be realistic and accept that change is going to happen
- It can also help us prepare for future change
- It can help us to enjoy the current moment as a moment in time not a moment that will last forever
