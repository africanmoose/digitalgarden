### Summary
- Most people will not give us feedback without us actively seeking it. We must cultivate those who will.

### Details

- Develop a network of those willing to give constructive feedback
- Most people who work directly with us know what we are doing wrong, but will not tell you.
- It takes patience to train those who will advise and coach us
