### Summary
- Learning in bits improves memory instead of in one long session

### Details
- Discovered by [[1x - References/11 Notes/11.05 Persons/Hermann Ebinghaus\|Hermann Ebinghaus]] from experiments he performed on himself
- Basically, the more sessions you provide to learn, the less total time you will require
- the space should be about 10-20% the time that you have to learn it (e..g if you have 10 days to learn, a daily session works. If you have 100 days, a session every 10 days.)
