### Summary
- When asking a question from a place of curiousity, it is better received, especially if we are in a position of power over others

### Details
- Have a sense of curiousity about people
- You can even say 'i'm curious' before asking the question
- open ended questions work better than leading questions, rhetorical questions, embarrasing questions or statements in the form of a question. Critical questions tend to shut down conversation.
- focus on solutions rather than on what went wrong
