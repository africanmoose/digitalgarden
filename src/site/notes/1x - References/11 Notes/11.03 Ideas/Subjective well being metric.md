### Summary
- Doing things you don't like can make you ineffective

### Details
- this could be jobs we are not good, working with people we dislike.
- When we enter a job in this frame of mind, we become anxious, irritable.
- Subjective well being is a metric that basically asks us 'how are you feeling?' and if we answer 'really good!' then thats how we are.
- This helps us identify tasks that make us feel (subjectively) happy and optimize for those.
- We may not stop doing tasks that dont make us feel good, but we can spend the minimum time on them, outsource them, find a way to eliminate them, or plan them so that we end with a task that makes us feel good.
