### Summary
- Created by Benjamin Bloom in 1956 to measure academic progress of college students.
- Describes 6 levels of understanding that we have complete in order to achieve the highest level of skill acquisition

### Details
- 6 levels that we have to complete:
	- Remember - retrieving relevant info
	- Understand - construct meaning from message (could be by interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, comparing, explaining)
	- Apply - Carry out/implement
	- Analyze - Break material into parts...determine how they relate to each other and to an overall structure
	- Evaluate - make judgements and check and critique
	- Create - putting the elements togetehr to form a new pattern or structure
- Can be argued that they should not be sequential and hierarchical levels and they may happen at the same time
