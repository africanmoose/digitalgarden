### Quotes
"Mistakes are an unavoidable part of life. even the most skilled people make mistakes, because there are so many factors beyond our knowledge and control that impact our success. This is true especially when we’re pushing the boundaries of knowledge or potential. On the frontier of what we can know or do, there are no wagon tracks to follow, no familiar landmarks, no mile markers, no road maps to guide us. We’re moving forward without the benefit of anyone else’s hindsight. Missteps will happen. Part of taking command of our lives is managing those missteps when they do happen. When things don’t work out the way we’d like, most of us default to blaming the world rather than ourselves. This is a form of what psychologists call self-serving bias: a tendency to evaluate things in ways that protect or enhance our self-image, which I mentioned earlier when discussing self-accountability. When people succeed at something, they tend to attribute their success to their own ability or effort: “I’m really smart”; “I worked really hard”; “I knew all the angles.” By contrast, when people fail at something, they tend to attribute their failure to external factors: “My boss doesn’t like me,” “The test was unfair,” etc."

There are three problems with covering up mistakes. The first is that you
can’t learn if you ignore your mistakes. The second is that hiding them becomes a habit. The third is that the cover-up makes a bad situation worse. Admitting error and correcting course is a time-saver that empowers you to avoid making more mistakes in the future. However, mistakes also provide rare opportunities for getting closer to the kind of person you want to be, should you choose to heed their lessons. Use those opportunities wisely! Don’t squander them. The four steps to handling mistakes more effectively are as follows: (1)
accept responsibility, (2) learn from the mistake, (3) commit to doing better, and (4) repair the damage as best you can.

Take time to reflect on what you contributed to the mistake, by exploring the various thoughts, feelings, and actions that got you here. If it’s an emergency, and you don’t have time to reflect at the moment, be sure to come back to it. If you don’t identify the problem’s causes, after all, you can’t fix them. And if you can’t fix them, you can’t do better in the future. Instead, you’ll be doomed to repeat the same mistake over and over.

Formulate a plan for doing better in the future. It could be a matter of building a strength like greater self-accountability or greater self confidence. "
