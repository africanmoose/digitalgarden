### Quotes
- Can you be too organized? Not in the pristine sense of how I define the word. If things aren’t where they should be, and accessible as you need them, you’re simply not organized enough. If you have created structural systems that are unduly complicated and that cause you to have difficulty in accessing what’s required, when it’s required, you are also disorganized.
