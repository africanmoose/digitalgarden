### Summary
- It is physically impossible to have all the information necessary to make a fully optimized decision.

### Details
- We are limited by:
	- imited information
	- limited mental capacity
	- limited time
- optimization is universally unlikely, yet we keep trying to achieve it.
- It makes much more sense to attain good enough even if there is a potential better option.
