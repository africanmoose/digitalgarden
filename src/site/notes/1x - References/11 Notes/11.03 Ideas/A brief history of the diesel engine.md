### Summary
- Diesel engines were patented by rudolf Diesel in 1892, using a different mode of fuel ignition from petrol engines.

### Details
- Diesel engines make use of fuel injection and spontaneous ignition due to temperature generated by compression. the pressure is higher than an Otto cycle engine, and offers several advantages: 40% efficiency (compared to 30% in Otto engine), lower speed, more torque. And finally diesel is not very flammable, making it safer for ships and military applications
- Diesel engines also last longer than petrol.
