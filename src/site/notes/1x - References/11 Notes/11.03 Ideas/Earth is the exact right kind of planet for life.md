### Summary
- The earth in many ways is exactly the correct type of planet to support life

### Details
Having a molten interior helps create the atmosphere
- Molten interior gives us a magnetic field that protects us from radiation
- It gives us plate tectonics that continually renew the service, otherwise the earth would weather down in time to be perfectly smooth, and covered in water to 4km average depth.
- The elements of the earth are in teh right proportions
- We have a large moon (which is unusual) but it steadies our orbit which is important for life
