### Summary
- We prefer stories to statistics

### Details
- When asking for donation, a group was shown a photo of a starving child. later on they donated an average of 2.83$ (they had been paid 5$ to complete the survey.)
- The second group were just shown statistics like 3 million children affected. The average donation dropped by half.
- This is illogical behaviour...but shows that we are moved my people and stories.
- Beware ads or requests that involve a human story. Ask for the facts and statistics.
- If you are asking for something, include a human story.
