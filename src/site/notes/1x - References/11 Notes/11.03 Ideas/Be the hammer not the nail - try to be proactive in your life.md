### Summary
- Change always happens, but we should try to be the one instigating the change rather than just responding to change

### Details
- For example, how we react to stress, how we deal with irritations in life. The irritation or stress will always be there, but we get to chose how to respond to it.

### Quotes
Personal change happens in a life field. That life field is complex and can change based on the social and environmental context you find yourself in. You don’t have to be the nail in your life field; you can be the hammer. Spend time this year reflecting and contemplating your life field and recognize all the driving and restraining forces surrounding different behaviors. Once you do, don’t only think about fueling up on the former factor, but also getting obstacles out of the way so you can fully step on the gas and accelerate your journey toward personal change.
