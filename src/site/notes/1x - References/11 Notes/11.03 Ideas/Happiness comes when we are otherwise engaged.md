### Quotes
- According to athlete, artist, and author Gregory Burns, a large amount of dopamine is released when we encounter something unexpected or when we take actions we’ve never taken before—in other words, when we feel that something is new.
- "It’s only when we are otherwise engaged—you know, focused, absorbed, inspired, communicating, discovering, learning—dancing, for heaven’s sake!—that we experience happiness as a by-product, a side effect. Oh, no, we should concern ourselves not so much with the pursuit of happiness, but with the happiness of pursuit. —Hector and the Search for Happiness"
