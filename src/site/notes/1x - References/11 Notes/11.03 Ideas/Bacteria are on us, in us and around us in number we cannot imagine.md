### Summary
- We have bacteria living in us, around us, and on is in numbers we cannot even understand.

### Details
- Even if you have good health and are pretty clean, there wil be about one trillion bacteria grazing on our skin. Every square centimeter is home to 100,000 bacteria.
- They dine on the flakes of dead skin, oils and minerals that our bodies shed.
- There are trillions more in your stomach, nasal passages, eyes, teeth
- Even if we make antibiotics and disinfectants make no difference to these numbers.
- We would not be able to live without them. They process waste, purify our water, convert food we eat into useful sugars, extract nitrogen from the air.
- Industries convert nitrogen out of air by heating source materials to 500 deg C and pressuring them to 300 times normal pressure, and bacteria do this for us with no fuss.
- Any handful of soil will contain up to 10 billino bacteria, and maybe a million yeasts, 200,000 molds and 10,000 protozoans
