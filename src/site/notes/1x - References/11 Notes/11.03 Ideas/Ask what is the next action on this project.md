If something is actionable, there is a next action associated with it, and you need to get that clear and park the answer in some trusted place before you can really get the subject off your mind.


I am restating and reinforcing the principle again in this chapter and in this context because, of all the best practices I have uncovered across the years of my work in this field of personal and interactive productivity, this one is perhaps the most profound in its ramifications. By asking myself, “What’s the next action on this?” I have generated more creative thinking, tough decision-making, critical conversations, innovative ideas, clarity, and motivation than by using any other specific technique I’m aware of.
