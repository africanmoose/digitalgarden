### Summary
- Often unexpected events happen. Sometimes these bring us unexpected costs, but sometimes they bring unexpected blessings. We must learn to appreciate the blessings. This may involve acknowledging that the costs were necessary.

### Details
- Often we are greedy: thinking about how much better we would like a situation to be rather than acknowleding the blessings
- Thinking of how much worse the situation could be may allow us to recognize the blessings. For example: You may have lost money, but you may have lost a friend. You may have lost a job, but you may have lost a limb.
- Appreciate what we have.
