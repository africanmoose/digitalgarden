### Summary
- hire people smarter than you.

### Details
- If you hire people better than you, everyone wins
- If you hire people not as good as you just to feel superior to them, then eventually the organization will be full of underdogs
- Encourage individuals more talented that you.
- You can only benefit from nurturing a star in the long run - they will overtake you anyway. In the meantime, learn from them and help them where you can

### Quotes
"In 1666â€“67, twenty-five-year-old Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was conducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor and became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behavior. When was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favor of a better candidate? And when was the last time you read about a CEO clearing out his desk when he realized that one of his twenty thousand employees could do a better job?""
