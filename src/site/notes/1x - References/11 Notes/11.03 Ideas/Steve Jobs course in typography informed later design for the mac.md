### Summary
- Steve Jobs took a course in calligraphy, out of pure interest. 10 years later this knowlege was put to use in designing fonts on the mac.
- There is value in having many varied skills in our repertoire, which can be connected in ways we may not have anticipated

### Details
- Overly focussed thinking would have impaired this serendipitous knowlege.
- Specialization reduces our number and type of dots to connect

### Quotes
- “10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me … and we designed it into the Mac … it was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never have had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them.” But when Jobs took the calligraphy class, he had no idea it would prove useful. He was pursuing his interests, and as he said, “It was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college … but it was very very clear looking backwards.”
