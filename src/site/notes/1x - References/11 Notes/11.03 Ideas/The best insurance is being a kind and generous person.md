### Quotes
- a wiseacre’s best insurance is being a kind and generous person that others would be willing to care for. The second best insurance is to treat the body well — eating healthy, organic food, exercising, reducing stress, being in nature and having a spiritual practice. Knowledge of how to heal common illnesses through working with medicinal plants would be additional insurance. You could investigate a high-deductible catastrophic illness plan for the worst case.
