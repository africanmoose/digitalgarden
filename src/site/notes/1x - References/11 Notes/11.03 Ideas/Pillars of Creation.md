### Quotes
- Hubble first imaged the Pillars of Creation in 1995 (see below), but the technology at the time revealed only a fraction of the stars in the region. The 2014 re-do provided considerably more detail, but the visible light snapshot still left the pillars relatively opaque and hid some of the forming stars. The James Webb observation is, in essence, a more complete representation of the nursery's activity.
- The James Webb Space Telescope's [sightseeing tour](https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-telescope-dust-rings-fingerprint-190504880.html) just provided a fresh look at one of the most recognizable interstellar objects. Researchers have [captured](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-takes-star-filled-portrait-of-pillars-of-creation) their most detailed image yet of the Pillars of Creation, a star-forming nursery in the Eagle Nebula roughly 6,500 light-years away. The near-infrared picture shows even more detail than [Hubble's 2014 snapshot](https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-08-big-picture-pillars-of-creation-hubble.html), with an abundance of stars (particularly newborns) in view — there isn't even a galaxy within sight.
