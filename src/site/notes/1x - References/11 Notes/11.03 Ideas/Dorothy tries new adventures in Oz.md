### Quotes
- Highlight: In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy is desperate to get home. This theme has helped the movie stand the test of time. But notice that her time away from home in the Land of Oz is actually more exciting, providing a thrilling experience in which she grows as a person and helps others along the way. (There’s a reason why, in the film version, the Oz sequences are in color while the Kansas parts are in black and white.) The lesson in this for us is that life away from home may be scary, but it’s full of potential
