### Summary
- Self-doubt is one of the things that make us human, and one of the things that make art possible.

### Details
- Flaws are human, the attraction of art is humanity. Human life has pain, insecurity and fear. We are imperfect and different and messy. And that might be what makes our work interesting and makes others art resonate wtih us. 
- We create art that has a bit of ourselves in it and if we are insecure, it will be reflected in our art.
