ANYWHERE A TRAVELER to seventeenth-century Venice turned an ear, they could hear music exploding from its traditional bounds. Even the name of the musical era, “Baroque,” is taken from a jewelers’ term to describe a pearl that was extravagantly large and unusually shaped.

Instrumental music—music that did not depend on words—underwent a complete revolution.
