### Summary
- Feedback loops are a key to learning
- We can only improve if we get feedback as to what to improve

### Details
- Seek out feedback
- Either positive or negative feedback is fine, so long as it is concrete
- Avoiding critical feedback because it may damage their positive self-image will never grow, and eventually will fall.
- Get pleasure out of changing rather than out of being praised.
