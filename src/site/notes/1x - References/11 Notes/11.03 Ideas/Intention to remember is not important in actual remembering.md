### Summary
- Intention does not really help us remember. What matters more is specific strategies to process and remember the information

### Details
- In one study, students were asked to study lists of words. One group was told to memorize, and that there would be a test. The second group were asked to sort into categories, or arrange them in columns. The categorizing and memorizing groups performed equally well in the test, and the arranging group performed worse
- This shows that intention doesnt really help us learn - processing does.
