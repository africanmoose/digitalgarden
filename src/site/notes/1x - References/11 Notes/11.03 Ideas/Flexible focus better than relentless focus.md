### Summary
- We need both to be able to focus on one thing as well as to be able to explore new ideas.

### Details
- Ochin Vartanian analysed nobel prize winners and other scientists adn concluded that flexible focus distinguishes them:  “Specifically, the problemsolving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.” (Vartanian 2009, 57)
