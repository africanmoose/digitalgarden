### Quotes
- Highlight: Give everything you own a “home”; it is essentially the key to feeling at peace in your space. Go through your belongings and only keep what’s purposeful or beautiful to you—and then assign each of those things a “home,” or a space to return to each night. It makes maintaining flow in your space effortless and calming
