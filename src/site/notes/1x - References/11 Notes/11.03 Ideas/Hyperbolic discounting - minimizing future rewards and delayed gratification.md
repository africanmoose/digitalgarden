### Summary
- The tendancy to place more importance on rewards in front of us and minimize rewards or punishments in future.

### Details
- This was proved in teh famous marchmallow test where children  who were able to wait for longer were rewarded wtih more marshmallows.
- further tests revealed that if the marshmallows were hidden under a tray, the children were able to wait ten times longer
- In the original experiment the children who waited did many things to avoid thinking about the marshmallows: sang, made funny faces, closed tehir eyes, etc.
- the children who did eat had been staring, maybe imagining how it would taste
