### Summary
- If the cost to undo a decision is low, make it as soon as possible.
- If the cost to undo a decision is high, make it as late as possible.

### Details
- If the decision is very unimportant, then just choose randomly.
- Similar to leaving space in front of you on the highway giving us extra options if there is any unexpected event. This is the same as giving as many options as far ahead as we can.

### Quotes
The asap principle: If the cost to undo the decision is low, make it as soon as possible.
In fact, if something is too inconsequential, then engaging in any decisionmaking might be a waste. Just choose. Decide quickly, and learn by doing. You’ll save time, energy, and resources that you can use for decisions that really matter.

The alap principle: If the cost to undo a decision is high, make it as late as possible.

In driver’s education, we learn that when you’re on the freeway driving
at high speeds, you need to keep a pocket open in front of you in case someone unexpectedly veers into your lane or stops abruptly. Keeping extra distance between cars allows you to keep options open for whatever might happen. This is the same reason you should wait as long as possible when making an important decision. You want to give yourself as many options in the future so that if something changes, you have the space to maneuver and reposition yourself along the path of greatest opportunity.
