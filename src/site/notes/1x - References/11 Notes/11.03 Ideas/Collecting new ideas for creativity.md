### Summary
- Be completely open, collecting all ideas that are of interest

### Details
- The seed phase - looking for starting points that can grow into something beautiful.
- We are not working on them - just gathering the ideas.
- We also dont form conclusions about them, or try to force them into a specific path
- Some ideas may end up growing into beautiful work, others that may seem exciting may not. In this early stage we cannot tell.
