### Summary
- We tend to overestimate an individuals influence and underestimate situation factors

### Details
- We attribute other peoples actions to their character, but attribute our own actions as external situational factors.
- For example if someone comes late: they are lazy. if we come late: there was bad traffic.
- We know our own character, motivation and situational factors but normally dont know anything about anyone else.
