### Summary
- The neocortex is the napkin size sheet of neural tissue that covers our brain. When we look at a brain, the grey wrinkled part that we see is the neocortex.

### Details
- It handles higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands spatial reasoning and language.
- There are regions for different areas but it is not so easy to categorize since they seem to be spread out in different places.
- one square mm of neocortex has about 100,000 neurons, 500 million connections (synapses) and several kilometers of axons and dendrites.
- Imagine a few kilometers of wire squeezed into the size of a grain of rice.
