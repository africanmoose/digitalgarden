### Summary
- 4 stages of learning:
	- Unconscious incompetence
	- Conscious incompetence
	- Conscious competence
	- Unconscious competence

### Details
- Unconscious incompetence: You dont know that you don't know. Perhaps we don't even know the skill exists, or if we do we have no idea what we are doing, where to start
- Conscious incompetence: You have learned enough to know that you don't know. Perhaps you have an idea now that you need to learn a lot, but you also have an idea of where to focus.
- Conscious competence: you know you need to do and you can do it. You are able to execute some aspects of your new skill
- Unconscious competence: You know what you know and you can do it without even thinking. You are an expert. You make few errors
- Interestingly, in order to learn something additional in a particular skill, we have to force ourselves down a level or two. For example we may be a unconscious competent driver, but if we want to learn how to be a rally driver we have to go down to conscious competence or even incompetence ini order to add this new skill to your skill set.
