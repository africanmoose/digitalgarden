### Summary
- Everything has Inertia

### Details
- In physics, it takes energy to start something, and something moving tends to stay moving (Newtons law of motion)
- This applies to our lives - starting something new is hard. Stopping something, even when it is for our own good, is difficult

### Quotes
The inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something.[1] We resist change even when change is for the best. The Latin word inertia means literally “inertness”: that is, laziness or
idleness. In physics, “inertia” refers to an object resisting a change in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating Newton’s first law of motion—the law of inertia—is this: “A body in motion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at rest.
