### Summary
- Distances in space are so vast, that they cannot really be drawn to scale. The pictures in most school text books are not really realistic

### Details
- For example, if earth was the size of a pea, Jupiter would have to be 300m away, and Pluto would be over 2km away, and the size of a bacterium.
- In this scale, the nearest star to us would be almost 10,000 miles away.
