### Summary
- Some who believe that intelligence is fixed (perhaps by genetics?) may take an IQ test to define their overall intelligence

### Details
- A measure of a performance on an intellectual task only measures your performance on that task, not you your broader intelligence, or your future intellectual potential, or future skills you may develop, or your worth as a person.
- One who believes in fixed intelligence may avoid learning when there is a risk of making errors or showing they are ignorant.
- The idea of learning means admitting that there is something you dont know.
- When do you feel smarter? when learning something new? or when doing something you are already good at?
