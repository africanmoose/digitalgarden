### Summary
- Our brain naturally takes what we know and makes connections to what we have learned. It is not copying

### Details
- We shouldn't feel guilty about learning from others. 
- What is important is that what is borrowed is compunded with our own experiences, thoughts and ideas and then expressed in a new way

### Quotes
- “What is at issue is not the fact of ‘borrowing’ or ‘imitating,’19 of being ‘derivative,’ being ‘influenced,’ but what one does with what is borrowed or derived,” wrote the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks in his essay “The Creative Self.” It’s all for the good, as long as the borrower “compounds it with one’s own experiences and thoughts and feelings,” and “expresses it in a new way, one’s own.”
