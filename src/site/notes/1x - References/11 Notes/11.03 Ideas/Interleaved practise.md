### Summary
- Learning one subject in an uninterrupted block is suboptimal. Better to divide the subjects and spend a bit of time on each one.

### Details
- For example, instead of spending 3hrs studying skill A, spend 1hr each on Skill A, B and C. 
- The harder the practise, teh more effective the learning. Thus interleaving makes it harder.
- Forces you to recall actively.
- Builds and reinforces connections between concepts or ideas.
