### Summary
- Create opportunities for serendipitious encounters
- Maximize these opportunities by being ready to try, and also to drop if it doesnt work
- Make your 'opportunity space' as large as possible
- Make your 'serendipity field' as large as possible


### Details
- Find ways to select opportunities that have a good chance of something interesting happening/little downside
- Break projects into stages whereby you can drop it with little cost if it doesnt seem to be working out
- Fast prototyping method
- As we create multiple opportunities, these in turn lead us to more connections and more ideas - 'compound serendipity'
- Serendipity field - the circles in which we have contacts - family, friends, professional contacts, hobbies etc. The more diverse our circles the more random connections we can make, the bigger our 'serendipity field'
