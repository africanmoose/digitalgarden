### Summary
- Paul Gleason, one of the worlds best firefighters, preferred to refer to it as 'making sense' rather than making a decsion. This allowed for adjustment in thinking as new information comes in as opposed to a decision that perhaps we may hold an emotional fondness and ownership of, blinding us to new data

### Details
- 'hunches held lightly' would allow him to adjust as the situation changed

### Quotes
When Weick spoke with hotshot Paul Gleason, one of the best wildland firefighters in the world, Gleason told him that he preferred to view his crew leadership not as decision making, but as sensemaking. “If I make a decision, it is a possession, I take pride in it, I tend to defend it and not listen to those who question it,” Gleason explained. “If I make sense, then this is more dynamic and I listen and I can change it.” He employed what Weick called “hunches held lightly.” Gleason gave decisive directions to his crew, but with transparent rationale and the addendum that the plan was ripe for revision as the team collectively made sense of a fire.
