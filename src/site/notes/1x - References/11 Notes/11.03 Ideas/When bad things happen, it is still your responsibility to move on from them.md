### Quotes
Just because something happened that was outside of your control doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility to deal with it the best you can. Our desire to protect ourselves prevents us from moving forward. It’s tempting to absolve yourself, throwing your hands up and claiming you have no control over the situation you’ve landed in. And sure, sometimes that’s true. There are circumstances of chance that have a negative impact. People suffer misfortune all the time for reasons beyond their control: stray bullets, diseases, getting struck by a drunk driver. Complaining does nothing to change the present situation you find
yourself in, though. Thinking about how it wasn’t your fault doesn’t make anything better. The consequences are still yours to deal with. Always focus on the next move, the one that gets you closer or further from where you want to go

You can put energy into things you control or things you don’t control.
All the energy you put toward things you don’t control comes out of the energy you can put toward the things you can. While no one chooses difficult circumstances, adversity provides opportunity. It allows us to test ourselves, and see who we’ve become. The test isn’t against other people, though; it’s against our former selves. Are we better than we were yesterday? When circumstances are easy, it’s hard to distinguish ordinary people from extraordinary ones, or to see the extraordinary within ourselves. As the Roman slave Publilius Syrus once said, “Anyone can steer the ship when the sea is calm.”[*]
