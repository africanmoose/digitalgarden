### Quotes
- "Metaknowledge can be thought of as a lack of hubris, an intellectual humility of sorts. Those who see the world probabilistically seem to better navigate volatile environments because they are wired to embrace uncertainty. They understand that they don’t know anything with 100 percent certainty, and are therefore open to ideas very different than their own."
