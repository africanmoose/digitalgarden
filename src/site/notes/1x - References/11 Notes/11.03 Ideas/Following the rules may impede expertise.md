### Summary
- A learner or beginner will tend to try and follow the rules. An expert will be more likely to judge each situation on its own merit and use experience to guide rather than rules.

### Details
- similar to removing training wheels from a bike: only when we remove them can we learn how to ride. its scary, but its teh only way.
- in one experiement, beginners and expert and teachers were shown scenes of CPR. the experienced paramedics were able to spot their fellow experienced paramedics in 90% of the cases. beginners were 50/50 (random guess). teachers were only right 30% of the time. Why? teachers emphasize following the rules, not doing the best thing for each situation.
- following rules will give you competence but not mastery. experts internalize the knowlege and dont have to actively remember rules. they tend to act by gut feeling on instinct.
