title: USA project things learned

[ ] DS: after training, implement immediately and methodically new thoughts (e.g. of the training agile)
[ ] schedule it, otherwise it doesnt get done
[ ] outlook class - email is not a task list. just communication. inbox should be zero
[ ] schedule shepherding calls
[ ] schedule recurring meetings with others who need regular updates
[ ] keep notes of meetings, especially recurring meetings in the format of: what was done last week? what is planned for next week? tasks assigned to individuals
[ ] speaking with users - plan a time for it
[ ] empathizing with other depts - not just write off their problems
[ ] document all work processes
[ ] sometimes, being too detailed or too organized can also waste time.
[ ] involve department contacts in incident solving and involve them more
[ ] schedule regular shepherding calls
