### Summary
- Either we are making things happen, or things are happening to us. 

### Details
- We are not entirely one or the other, so we want to allow others to influence us positively. 
- But we should primarily aim to be an agent rather than being acted upon.
- We can do this by:
	- being sure of our values rather than following the crowd
	- acquiring skills of every kind: mental, physical, emotional. The more skills we have the more we are likely to be able to control circumstances rather than be controlled
	- We need to decide what action and direction we are moving rather than being passive and not doing anything
