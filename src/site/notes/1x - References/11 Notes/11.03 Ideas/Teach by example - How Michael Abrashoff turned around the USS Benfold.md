### Summary
- The USS Benfold was a warship in the US navy, commissioned in 1996. It has advanced tech, but performed badly and the crew could not wait to get out.
- Michael Abrashoff changed it when he was named commander to be one of the highest performing ships.

### Details
- He did not order people around, or fire them. 
- He just started waiting in line like everyone else for meals and eating with them instead of using rank privilege to cut in front of the line and eat with the officers.
- he listened to people: scheduling 1hr with each soldier to talk about them about what was important to them: families, goals etc.
- Took peoples ideas and implemented them: 21 year old soldier had the idea of using stainless steel bolts so that there would be less maintenance. now the entire navy uses them.

### Quotes
The story of the USS Benfold provides an important example of how to recognize and overcome blind spots.[2] The Benfold was one of the worst-performing warships in the entire US Navy. Commissioned in 1996 for duty in the Pacific Fleet, it housed one of the Navy’s most advanced arsenals of missiles and technology at the time. Its radar system was so advanced that it could track a bird from fifty miles. Its mission was to be prepared for war at all times. But it was falling short. Despite otherwise brilliant military careers, previous commanders had
been unable to turn its performance around. So much of a ship’s performance comes down to people, not technology. There’s nothing more important for a leader than getting the most out of your crew. Often that comes down to removing obstacles that limit potential. All the technology in the world isn’t going to make you better if the people using it are checked out. The destiny of the USS Benfold changed the day Michael Abrashoff was
named commander. He was in his mid-thirties when the Navy offered him the Benfold, his first sea command. At the time, he said, the “dysfunctional ship had a sullen crew that resented being there and could not wait to get out of the Navy.” And yet, in under twenty months, Abrashoff turned the Benfold into one of the highest-performing ships in the Navy. And he did it within a stifling hierarchy. But how? What’s incredible is how he didn’t do it. He didn’t fire or demote anyone. He didn’t change the hierarchy. He didn’t change any technology. The only real change was within himself. He started to identify his potential blind spots, and to look at the world from the crew’s perspective. Abrashoff observed one of the ship’s usual Sunday afternoon cookouts shortly after assuming command, and noticed a long line of sailors waiting to get their lunch while officers cut to the head of the line to get their food. Not only that, but after getting their food, the officers went to a private deck to eat apart from the sailors. Imagine you’re a sailor on the ship and your boss comes and hops the line in front of you. What message does this send? Does it make you want to go all in on your job? Does it make you want to come up with new ideas to help the ship? “The officers weren’t bad people,” Abrashoff recalls, “they just didn’t know any different. It’s always been that way.” Rather than approaching the officers and telling them what to do (a typical command-and-control approach that rarely works in the long term), Abrashoff simply went to the end of the line. A supply officer approached him and said, “You don’t understand. You go to the head of the line.” Abrashoff shrugged this off, saying it didn’t seem right to him. He waited in line, got his food, and then sat down with the sailors. The next weekend everyone waited in line and ate together. No command was ever issued. From the start, Abrashoff knew you can’t simply order people to be better. Even if that appears to work, the results are short term and the consequences enormous. It doesn’t matter if you’re on a ship or running a manufacturing company. You don’t tap into people’s resourcefulness, intelligence, and skills by command-and-control.
