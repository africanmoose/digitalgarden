### Quotes
- "Kanie -san tells me, ‘We don’t need much to live a good life. When you are grateful for what you do have, and share it with those you love, whatever else you need comes.’ Her deep appreciation of the gifts of a simple life is wabi sabi personified. She goes on: ‘Don’t waste energy worrying about what you don’t have. That is the route to misery. Instead, pay attention to the good already present in your life, and do your best at whatever you are doing. There is joy in the satisfaction of that.' Mineyo Kanie, the ninety-four-year-old daughter of the late Gin-san , at her home in Nagoya. Gin-san and her twin sister Kin-san were known for being the world’s oldest identical twins, living to 108 and 107 respectively."
