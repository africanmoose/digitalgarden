### Quotes
"Don't worry about being the most interesting person in the room, just try to be the most interested person in the room.
- The interested person asks about others and leaves a good impression because people like talking about themselves.
- The interested person is genuinely curious about someone's craft and learns a lot about how things work.
- The interested person engages with more people and—because opportunities come through people—is more likely to catch a lucky break.
In general, the interested person learns more and tends to be well-liked. And in the long run, it's hard to keep down someone who is well-learned and well-liked."
