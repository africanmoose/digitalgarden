### Summary
- We can take practical steps to at teh very least minimize the impact of inflation, if not become completely inflation proof
- Even though there is inflation, most of us live much better than our forbears of even a couple of generations ago. So income is also rising. Sometimes our lifestyle could also be inflating.

### Details
- Some tips:

- buy for durability, repairability, utility and flexibility (might never have to replace certain items)
- possible to bike to work?
- learn to do skills yourself such as maintenance and repair of your stuff.
