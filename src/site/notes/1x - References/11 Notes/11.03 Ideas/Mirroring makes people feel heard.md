- Former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss says that a shortened form of paraphrasing known as “mirroring”29 is a tactic that can help defuse tense discussions. It involves repeating several key words that have just been said, phrasing it as a question. For example, if someone said, “I feel as if nobody in this company cares about all the work I’ve done,” you’d mirror that by saying, “Nobody in the company cares?” As Voss explains, the tactic encourages people to better explain themselves—and makes them feel as if they’re being heard. The journalist Frank Sesno uses a similar technique that he calls an “echo question,” which can consist of as little as one word. In the example given above, the echo question would be: “Nobody?”
