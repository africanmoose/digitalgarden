### Summary
- Cognitive psychologists distinguish between 2 types of consciousness: spotlight and lantern. Spotlight means attention is focussed on one point. Lantern means that attention is more broad.

### Details
- Children tend to have lantern consciousness. 
- Lantern leads to more association, dreaminess, and making interesting connections - creativity.
- Spotlight allows one to focus on one specific area in a linear and efficient way.
- Caffeine allows one to have more efficient spotlight consciousness, in comparison to most psychedelic drugs which tend to allow lantern creativity.
