### Details
- It was called the Pig War because it was triggered by teh shooting of a pig. There were no casualties.
- There had been some dispute about the actual boundary between US and UK. The matter remained unresolved for a long time (13yrs)
- An American farmer named Luman Cutlar moved to the disputed San Juan island. One day he found a pig rooting in his garden and he shot the pig and killed it. It had been owned by an Irishman who was employed by Britains Hudson's Bay company. Cutlar offered 10$ compensation, but Griffin demanded $100. 
- One account has Cutlar saying "It was eating my potatoes" to which Griffin replied "It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig."
- British authorities threated to arrest Cutlar, and he called for military protection. Each side called in reinforcements
- Things escalated until 461 Americans with 14 cannons were facing 5 british warships with 70 guns and 2,140 men.
- British Rear Admiral Robert L. Baynes, who was in command of the British Navy in the Pacific, would arrive himself. When Baynes finally came and took stock of the situation, he told Governor Douglas that he would not escalate the conflict into a war between great nations "over a squabble about a pig"
- both sides agreed to have joint military occupation of the island, which continued for 12 years. There was mutual visiting and various social and athletic affairs
