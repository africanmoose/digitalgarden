### Summary
- We see patterns where none actually exists

### Details
- For example, seeing shapes in the clouds, or faces in our toast.
- We are oversensitive to patterns
- If we think we are seeing a pattern, consider it pure chance.
- To be sure, data should be tested statistically by a mathematician
