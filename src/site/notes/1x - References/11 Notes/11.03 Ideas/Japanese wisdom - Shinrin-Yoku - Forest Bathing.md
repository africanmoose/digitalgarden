### Summary
- Going to a forest, or indeed any natural place, gives many physical, mental and spiritual benefits

### Details
- When we do get into nature, we should focus and enjoy and experience - the sounds, feel and sights. We fully immerse ourselves in the experience of being in nature.
- One idea: 20-5-3 rule. 20 minutes 3x a week in a city park, 5 hours a month in a semi-wild area like a park. 3 days cmaping or backpacking in wilderness
