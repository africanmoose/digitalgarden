### Summary
- We have a limited capacity for work in progress, or number of items going at the same time. if we get too many, then all slow down. so its more efficient to try and do as few things as possible at the same time

### Details
- juggling flaming torches: 3 might be comfortable (for an expert) but as you add torches it gets more and more stressful until you get to breaking point, at which point you drop all the torches.
- Another good example is a highway. its capacity could be anywhere from empty to 100% full. but when every space available is full, the cars cannot move. we optimize for throughput, not capacity.  if we keep part of our capacity available, it also allows slower and faster traffic to coexist.
- throughput more important than capacity
- work flows rather than tis
- Thoughtful prioritization is better than up font planning
