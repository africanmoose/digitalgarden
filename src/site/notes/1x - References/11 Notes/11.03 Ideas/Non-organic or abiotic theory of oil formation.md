### Summary
- Most theories of oil formation theorize that it is made from decomposition of long dead microorganisms. Abiotic theory supposes that there can be a non-organic source, as proved by hydrocarbons being discoverd on Saturns moon Titan.

### Details
- There are additional lines of possible proof, but all are not clear since there are also lines of proof for organic formation.
