### Summary
- A ruthless edit is one in which we only leave what absolutely has to be there in order for the work to be still itself

### Details
- This is different from a trim, or editing just the excess
- This helps us to know what the underlying structure is, and what really matters
- We see what each component contributes, and what is absolutely necessary
