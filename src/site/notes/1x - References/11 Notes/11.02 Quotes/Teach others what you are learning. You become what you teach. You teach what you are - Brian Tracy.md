## Quote
Teach others what you are learning. You become what you teach. You teach what you are.

When you attempt to articulate and explain a new concept to someone else, you understand it and internalize it better yourself. You only really know something to the degree to which you can teach it to someone else, and have them understand and apply it in their own lives.
