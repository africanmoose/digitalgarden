## Quote
"Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately  hate them!"
"He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice. This disgrace  to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at  command, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base  an action. It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder."
