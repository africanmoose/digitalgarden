### Quotes
A colleague once asked Gass if he had any unusual writing habits:
“No, sorry to be boring,” he sighed.… 
“How does your day begin?” 
“Oh, I go out and photograph for a couple of hours,” he said. 
“What do you photograph?” 
“The rusty, derelict, overlooked, downtrodden parts of the city. Filth and decay mainly,” he said in a nothing-much-to-it tone of voice, as casually dismissive as the wave of a hand. 
“You do this every day, photograph filth and decay?” 
“Most days.” 
“And then you write?” 
“Yes.” 
“And you don’t think that’s unusual?”
“Not for me.”
