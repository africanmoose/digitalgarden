### Summary
- Anthony Trollope was an English novelist and civil servant (1815-1882)

### Details
- Trollope wrote 47 novels, 42 short stories, and five travel books.
- He achieved this by writing habitually 2 and a half hours every day even though he worked full time.
- He would start the next project as soon as he finished the previous one, so long as it fit in his 2 and a half hours schedule.
- Once he completed a lengthy work of 600 pages. Since he had 15min remaining of his usual two and a half hours he simply put it aside and started work on the next one.
- He started work every morning at 5.30am. 'it as also my practice to allow myself no mercy. An old groom, whose business it was to call me, and to who I paid Â£5 a year extra for the duty, allowed himself no mercy. During all those years at Waltham Cross he never was once late with the coffee which it was his duty to bring me. I do not know that I ought not to feel that I owe more to him than to any one else for the success I have had."
- he believed 3hrs a day was enough to accomplish a lot, so long as he had trained himself to write continously during the three hours.
- His mother, Frances Trollope, was also an aiuther. She did not start writing till 53 years old, and then only because she needed the money. She would start each day by writing at 4am.
