### Quotes
- Although a very learned person, the Humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus despised his education and thought the university professors were too obsessed with useless details and strange paradoxes. For Erasmus, when learning goes to its extreme, it divorces students from their humanity. When offered prominent teaching positions and government posts, he declined them all and became a travelling scholar. And instead of just writing about scholarly texts, he extended his work to all spheres of life, including friendships, manners and love.
- In his writings Erasmus satirically exposed clergy abuses, their pompous lifestyle, and the ambition of popes who applauded wars. He differed with corrupt clergymen who used church customs​—such as confession of sins, the worship of the saints, fasting, and pilgrimages—​to exploit believers. He also disagreed with such church practices as the sale of indulgences and enforced celibacy.
- In the preface to his New Testament, Erasmus wrote: “I vehemently dissent from those who would not have private [common] persons read the Holy Scriptures nor have them [the Scriptures] translated into the vulgar [common] tongues.”
