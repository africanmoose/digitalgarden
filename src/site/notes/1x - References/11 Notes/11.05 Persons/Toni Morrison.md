### Summary
- African-American author of many novels, poems, plays and short stories. 1931-2019

### Details
- She was prolific despite having a full time job as an editor for Random house and also teaching university literature and raising her two sons.
- How did she handle all this? “It does seem hectic, but the important thing is that I don’t do anything else. I avoid the social life normally associated with publishing. I don’t go to the cocktail parties, I don’t give or go to dinner parties. I need that time in the evening because I can do a tremendous amount of work then. And I can concentrate"
