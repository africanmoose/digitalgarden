## Quote
I watch people in the world  
Throw away their lives lusting after things,  
Never able to satisfy their desires,  
Falling into deeper despair  
And torturing themselves.  
Even if they get what they want  
How long will they be able to enjoy it?  
For one heavenly pleasure  
They suffer ten torments of hell,  
Binding themselves more firmly to the grindstone.  
Such people are like monkeys  
Frantically grasping for the moon in the water  
And then falling into a whirlpool.  
How endlessly those caught up in the floating world suffer.  
Despite myself, I fret over them all night  
And cannot staunch my flow of tears.
