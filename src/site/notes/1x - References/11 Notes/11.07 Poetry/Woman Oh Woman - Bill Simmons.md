Woman, Oh Woman
  	
Woman, Oh woman
Why do you make me feel
Every time I'm near you
My heads a spinning wheel

Woman, Oh woman
What have you done to me
Woman, Oh woman
Did you cast a spell on me

Woman, Oh woman
When you touch me, I chill
When you kiss me, I'm in heaven
I've known nothing so real

Woman, Oh woman
When I gaze into your eyes
I'm blinded by the passion
I feel that's deep inside

Woman, Oh woman
Did you over do your spell
My hearts in many pieces
It sadens me to tell

Woman, Oh woman
What have you done to me
Woman, Oh woman
Did you cast a spell on me

Woman, Oh woman
In sadness I do tell
My hearts in tiny pieces
Did you over do your spell.

Bill Simmons
