## Quote
The blue sky and the bright sun in the first days of spring
As all around becomes verdant and fresh
Carrying my bowl I amble onwards towards the village
The children, surprised to see me,
Joyfully gather around so bringing
My begging trip to a conclusion by the temple gate,
I put my bowl on the top of a white rock,
Hang my bag on the branch of a tree,
And then play with a ball and the wild grasses
For a while we play catch as the children sing,
And then I take my turn. 
Playing with abandon I loose all track of time.
People passing by point and laugh asking,
"What is the reason for such foolishness?"
I respond only with a deep bow,
For even if I answered it would be beyond their understanding,
Look around, there is nothing more than this.
