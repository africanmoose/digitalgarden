## Quote
Yes, I’m truly a dunce  
Living among trees and plants.  
Please don’t question me about illusion and enlightenment --  
This old fellow just likes to smile to himself.  
I wade across streams with bony legs,  
And carry a bag about in fine spring weather.  
That’s my life,  
And the world owes me nothing.
