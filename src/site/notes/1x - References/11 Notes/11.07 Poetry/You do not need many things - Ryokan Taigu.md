## Quote
My house is buried in the deepest recess of the forest  
Every year, ivy vines grow longer than the year before.  
Undisturbed by the affairs of the world I live at ease,  
Woodmen’s singing rarely reaching me through the trees.  
While the sun stays in the sky, I mend my torn clothes  
And facing the moon, I read holy texts aloud to myself.  
Let me drop a word of advice for believers of my faith.  
To enjoy life’s immensity, you do not need many things.
