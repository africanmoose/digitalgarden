## Quote
What is more gentle than a wind in summer?
What is more soothing than the pretty hummer?
That stays one moment in an open flower,
And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?
What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing
In a green island, far from all mens knowing?
More healthful than the leafiness of dales?
More secret than a nest of nightingales?
More full of visions than a high romance?
What, but thee, sleep? Soft closer of our eyes
