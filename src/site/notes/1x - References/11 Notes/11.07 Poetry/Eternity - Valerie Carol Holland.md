Twin souls who can't exist apart
Two hearts must join to make them start,
To beat together for our lives.
We'll be together all our lives.

And after that who knows what place,
will find us hand in hand to face
Another lifetime can we dare,
to hope that on and on we'll share,
Eternity for evermore,
For surely we have loved before.

The mists of time are but a veil,
To curtain hearts that never fail.
To recognise each other when,
We join together once again.

Then hand in hand just as before,
We'll walk once more through passions door
And though we die our love survives
We'll be together all our lives.
