### Summary
- American  polymath: mathematician, electican engineer and cryptographer
- Known as the father of information theory

### Details
- He studied communication and need a measure for the amount of information exchanged when 2 entities communicate. THe measure he came up with is called 'surprisal', also known as information content, shannon information. How much information is contained in a message is determined by how surpising the message is.
- A mature zettelkasten will give you lots of ideas you put in a long time ago and have since forgotten surprising you in new ways.
- In 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the [game-tree complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity "Game complexity") of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"), which is approximately 10^120^. This number is now often referred to as the "[Shannon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number "Shannon number")", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity.
- worked with Vannevar Bush on differential analyzer machine
- 1940 worked on a thesis about switching circuits that became the basis of modern computers (and and or gates)
- saw that the bit was the fundamental part of digital communication
- it is always more efficient to change the data into bits before transmission
- also interested in juggling and poetry
