### Quotes
- A strong candidate is Thomas Young. Born in 1773 in Somerset, England, Young read widely from an early age. By the age of twenty-one, he was a fellow of the Royal Society, Britain’s preeminent science society with origins dating back to 1660, and had presented a paper that set the foundation of our current understanding of human vision. By his early thirties, as a practicing doctor, he had delivered a series of lectures that his biographer, Andrew Robinson, described as “covering virtually all of known science, which has never been surpassed in scope and boldness of insight.”4 Over the course of his life, Young made important contributions across a wide range of fields, including physics, physiology, engineering, music, and philology (the study of language in written historical sources—I had to look that up, not being someone who knows everything). He studied over four hundred languages, which allowed him to lay the groundwork for deciphering the Rosetta Stone. And oh, before I forget, he also took on Isaac Newton and demonstrated that light was as much a wave as it was a particle.
When not moving human knowledge forward at a breakneck pace, Young advised leaders on matters as diverse as the introduction of gas lighting in London, the proper mathematics necessary to understand risk in life insurance, and the relative effectiveness of various shipbuilding methods.
In Young’s story, we see a tension between pursuing breadth and depth. Knowing that all of us have limited time and attention, we tend to be skeptical of those who seem unfocused and contribute in numerous arenas without really committing to any. Recognizing the suspicion held by society toward those with multiple interests, Young made most of his contributions anonymously, trying to minimize the risk of being considered a jack-of-all-trades. He feared that, if his wide-ranging interests were public, they would scare patients away from his medical practice. Even then, depth was valued more than breadth.
In 1973, the London Science Museum designed an exhibit to celebrate Thomas Young’s two hundredth birthday. The organizers noted that “Young probably had a wider range of creative learning than any other Englishman in history. He made discoveries in nearly every field he studied.”5 Any wonder why Andrew Robinson titled his biography of Young The Last Man Who Knew Everything?
