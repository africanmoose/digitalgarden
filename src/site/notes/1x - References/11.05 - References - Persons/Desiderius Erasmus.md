### Quotes
- Although a very learned person, the Humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus despised his education and thought the university professors were too obsessed with useless details and strange paradoxes. For Erasmus, when learning goes to its extreme, it divorces students from their humanity. When offered prominent teaching positions and government posts, he declined them all and became a travelling scholar. And instead of just writing about scholarly texts, he extended his work to all spheres of life, including friendships, manners and love.
