### Quotes
- earlier gave an introduction to author Anthony Trollope, who is, for me, a sort of god of habits. A post office employee, he was the person who came up with Englandâ€™s iconic red pillar-shaped boxes. He made it his task to spend two and a half hours writing before going to work. He wrote forty-seven novels and sixteen other works while working full-time, leaving behind a sizable oeuvre in the history of literature.
His secret to producing so many works was starting the next project as soon as he finished the previous one. Once, he completed a lengthy work that comprised six hundred pages. A normal author would have wanted, perhaps, to celebrate, or take plenty of vacation time. But because he had about fifteen minutes remaining until his usual two and a half hours were up, after finishing the manuscript, he simply put it aside and got started on his next one.
