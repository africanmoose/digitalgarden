### Summary
- No matter how much you prepare and learn about a new skill, at some point you have to start doing it.

### Details
- Effective practise need to be self-test rather than mindless review
- study in 2008 by Jeffrey Karpicke of Purdue University, group of students were given vocab words to learn. Students who used active recall remembered 80% of the new words versus 34% for those who only passively reviewed the words.
- Practise is hard. if its not, you are not doing it right
- Aggressive review: study problematic areas deliberately and repetitively, test your understanding
- For example when learning a new instrument/song focus on the problem area instead of the teh whole song. once it is learned move on to another area
