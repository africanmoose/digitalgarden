## Quote
"All of this is as it should be, because none of you is special. You’re not special.… You’re not exceptional.” He went on to note the empirical evidence. Three point two million high school graduates across the United States from around 37,000 high schools: “That’s 37,000 valedictorians … 37,000 class presidents … 92,000 harmonizing altos … 340,000 swaggering jocks … 2,185,967 pairs of UGGs.”18
As the audience nervously laughed during his speech, McCullough continued, noting that even being one in a million meant there were thousands of others of comparable uniqueness. And he noted that in a world where everyone is special, no one is. “If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless.”

His ultimate advice is to change our focus. To look inward for motivation, to think for ourselves, to not allow the sentiment of others drive our behavior: “Climb the mountain not to plant your flag but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air, and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you. Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your list and congratulate yourself for being worldly.… The sweetest joys in life, then come only with the recognition that you’re not special … because everyone is.”
