### Quotes
- "If you think about who you truly admire, itâ€™s likely that you will include someone older than you in your list. And yet we find it hard to see the value of ageing in ourselves. We spend valuable time and money trying to cling to our youth on the surface, while ignoring the beauty and wisdom of age underneath."
