### Summary
- Taking time off to disconnect can give a competitive advantage, since everyone else is consuming the same thing.

### Details
- Turn off the phone and internet, focus, produce and create.
- Everyone else is on social media, so there is no competitive edge from also being there.
- Open your mind to many options, and think abou tthem all however ridiculous they might be.
