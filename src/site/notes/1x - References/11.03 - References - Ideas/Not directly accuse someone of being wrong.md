### Summary
- When accuse someone of being wrong, you potentially block a path to agreement

### Details
- When you accuse someone, the immediately go on the defensive.
- Better first to validate their stance: "thats interesting. i have never thought of that" and then present your own opinion: "i recently learned of this...."
- Then ask their opinion: "what do you think about that?"
- Conversation is more useful than defense
