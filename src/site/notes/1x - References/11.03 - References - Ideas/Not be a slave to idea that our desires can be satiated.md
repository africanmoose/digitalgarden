### Summary
- The idea that desires can be satiated is a fallacy - behind one desire is an inexhaustible line of others

### Details
- The way to find independence is by not taking more than we need.
- If we only use what we need to maintain our health, then there is freedom from the never ending desire to have more.
- We can find peace and not need to spend so much time earning money to satiate desires which are never ending
