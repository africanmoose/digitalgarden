### Summary
- Filtering is when we chose only particular details of a situation - particularly negative ones - and focus solely on that.

### Details
- Picking a particular detail can color our view of the entire event

### Quotes
- "Filtering is choosing to have a selectively informed perspective. It is to take the negative details of a situation and magnify them while filtering the positive aspects out. Picking out a single detail and coloring entire events by it isolates “good” and “bad” experiences from one another, and therefore, they become larger and more awful (or better) than they are in reality."
