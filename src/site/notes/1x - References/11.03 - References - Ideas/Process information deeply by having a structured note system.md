### Summary
- Scientists believe that one of hte most important factors to determine if we will remember it is how deeply we process it.

### Details
- Processing involves encoding the information learnt into our brain in a way that it can be easily retrieved
- Structured information is easier to encode than disorganized infroamtion
- The type of structure is up to you - hierarchical, mind-mapping, etc. Whatever method you use should be clear, easy and understandable
- One method may involve asking yourself questions:
	- how does relate to other things i have learned?
	- what are the implications of this
	- why does it make sense?
	- what are the steps i need to take to solve this problem?
