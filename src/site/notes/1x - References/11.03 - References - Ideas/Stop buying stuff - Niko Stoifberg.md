### Summary
- Buying services is better than buying things

### Details
- Niko Stoifberg experimented with not buying stuff for one year. The only rules:
	- no dying - still buy food
	- no stinking - still buy soap, toothpaste
- preferred to buy services instead of goods
- services support local economy, generate less waste, promote social interactions (e..g talking to a shoemaker instead of buying new shoes online)
- happiness from experience lasts longer than the high from a purchase.
- Conclusion: created a rule - when you buy something new either replace something old and completely used up or something broken.
