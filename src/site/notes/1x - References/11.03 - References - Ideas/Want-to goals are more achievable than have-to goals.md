### Summary
- When we have goals we have to attain, the more obstacles and temptations we preceive. When we have want-to goals, we preceive less obstacles, making our goals more achievable without extra effort

### Details
- The study involved students who wantedt o eat healthy but more frequently felt hungry, or preceived that they didnt have time to cook. they also rated unhealthy food as more healthy.
- however, when the students had want-to goals, htey perceived fewer obstacles
- the lesson is that we are way more likely to achieve goals that we want to achieve rather than have to.
