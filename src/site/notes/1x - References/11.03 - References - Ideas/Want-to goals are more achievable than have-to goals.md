- Highlight: The more have-to motivations the students had, the more obstacles and temptations they perceived (more self-control conflict). For example, students who wanted to eat healthy for have-to reasons reported that they frequently felt hungry, didn’t have time to cook or that a flatmate was buying junk food. Interestingly, they also rated unhealthy food as more tasty (and healthy food as less tasty) than students who had want-to reasons.[71]
			Although students made more effort towards their have-to goals, the extra effort was cancelled out by increased subjective perception of obstacles and temptations.
			In contrast, the more want-to motivations the students had for their goals, the fewer obstacles and temptations they perceived (less self-control conflict). For this reason, students were more successful in achieving their want-to goals without having to make extra effort.
			This study shows that it’s much better to bolster your want-to rather than have-to motivations. If you only have have-to motivations, then you’ll experience self-control conflict. You’ll know you should choose the option with the delayed reward, but you’ll want the option with the immediate reward.
			On the other hand, if you have strong want-to motivations for your goals, you will automatically experience fewer obstacles and temptations
