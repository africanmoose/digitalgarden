### Quotes
-Entrepreneur and venture capitalist Paul Graham on the importance of being at least a little bit contrarian:
"Let's start with a test: Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?
If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that possibly be a coincidence?
Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told."
