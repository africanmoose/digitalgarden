### Summary
- When there is information asssymetry (for example a doctor or architect who knows much more than you), dont be intimidated into turning off your brain. 

### Details
- Ignore 'visible power dynamics' or cues like a white coat that try to telegraph the imbalance
- They are valuable inputs into decision making, but at the end of the day, the decision maker is you.
