### Quotes
- When visiting a doctor, taking advice from a financial expert, or even making a high-stakes decision at work, it’s critical that you think for yourself. Don’t let information asymmetry intimidate you into turning off your brain. There may be visible power dynamics that also telegraph the knowledge imbalance, but that doesn’t change the reality that only you can fully understand the complete context of your decision. The advice and guidance you receive from others are tiles in a mosaic that you are forming—they’re inputs into your decision making. Not more, not less. Just inputs.
