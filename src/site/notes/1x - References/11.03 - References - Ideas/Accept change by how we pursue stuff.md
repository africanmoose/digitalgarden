### Quotes
- "Over the years, we paste layers over our natural beauty in our endless pursuit of perfection – with anti-ageing creams, accumulated stuff, job titles and projected images that we think might make other people like us better. But all that is heavy, and it masks what lies within. It’s only when you strip back the layers that you let your inner beauty shine."
