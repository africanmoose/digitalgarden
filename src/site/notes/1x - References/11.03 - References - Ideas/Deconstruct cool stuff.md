### Summary
- if you see something that appeals to you, try to figure out how it was done.

### Details
- If you see an amazing performance, try and understand how it was done: what makes it great? how they engage with the audience? musical instruments? singing? energy?
- Delicious meal - how was it cooked? presented? ingredients?
- Beautiful photo - where was it taken? what time of day? what makes it amazing?

### Quotes
- "When something fascinates you, pay attention to the details. The person who thinks, "That was cool" is a consumer. The person who thinks, "How did they make something that cool?" is on the path to being a creator." - James Clear 321 email 20221215
