### Summary
- Learning takes hard work. Learning needs deliberate practise. It requires effort. 

### Details
- trying to avoid work might be compared to hiring a coach to help us in the gym, then making him do teh work while we watch. The one doing the work is the one getting the benefit.
- When teachers arrange information for us, sort it into categories, they are the ones doing the work and learning, and making it hard for the student ot make these connections himself.
