### Summary
- Our memory is encoded with the state in which we learned something. Might be our emotional state, or physical location, or even whether we are drunk or high. It is easier to remember when we are in the same state as when the memory was encoded

### Details
- The context of our memory encoding is anything - it could be location, music, smells, company etc.
