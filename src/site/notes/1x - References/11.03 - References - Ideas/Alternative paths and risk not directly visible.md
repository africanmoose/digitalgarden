### Summary
- Risk cannot be seen directly, so we have to deliberately force ourself to think about it.

### Details
- This can be done by thinking about alternate paths. for example, a risky way of doing something may pay off, but it may not. If it does we should consider the other possible outcome before trying another risky endeavor and recognise the success was a chance
- You will try to attribute success to hard work instead of chance. fight this tendancy.
