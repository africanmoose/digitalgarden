### Summary
- One central vision versus many general things.

### Details
- Greek poet Archilochus gave a metaphor: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” As far as I can tell, he did not elaborate on this idea, but in 1953 philosopher Isaiah Berlin used this as a basis to divide people into hedgehogs: those who pursue one big idea, and foxes, who focus on many different things
- It could be summarised as specialists vs generalists
