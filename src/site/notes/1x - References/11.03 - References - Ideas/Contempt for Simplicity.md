### Quotes
- "one of our most dysfunctional beliefs is our contempt for simplicity and structure. we believe that we are above needing structure to help us on seemingly simple tasks.
- This is a natural response that combines three competing impulses: 1. our contempt for simplicity 2. our contempt for instruction and follow-up 3. the faith that we can succeed all by ourselves.
