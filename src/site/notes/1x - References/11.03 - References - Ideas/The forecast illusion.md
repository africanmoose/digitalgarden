### Summary
- No one can foretell the future

### Details
- Philip Tetlock evaluated more than 28,000 predictions over 10 years from 284 professionals. They were unable to foretell the future. They perforemed only slightly better than a random forecast generator.
- Professional forecasters tend to be even worse than average.
