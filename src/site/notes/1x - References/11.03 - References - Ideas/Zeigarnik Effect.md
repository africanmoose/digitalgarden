### Summary
- Zeigarnik Effect - a task interrupted will be more readily recalled 
- Refinement: Make a plan - it will be less stressful

### Details
- Zeigarnik noticed that waiters who had orders unfinished could recall them well. But as soon as the orders were completed, they promptly forgot them.
- Later on Roy Baumeister did further research on this to conclude that outstanding tasks only bother us until we have a clear idea of how to deal with them.

### Quotes
- "He took students who were a few months away from their final examinations and split them into three groups. Group 1 had to focus on a party during the current semester. Group 2 had to concentrate on the exam. Group 3 had to focus on the exam and also create a detailed study plan. Then Baumeister asked students to complete words under time pressure. Some students saw “pa . . .” and filled in “panic,” while others thought of “party” or “Paris.” This was a clever method of finding out what was on each of their minds. As expected, group 1 had relaxed about the upcoming exam, while students in group 2 could think of nothing else. Most astonishing was the result from group 3. Although these students also had to focus on the upcoming exam, their minds were clear and free from anxiety. Further experiments confirmed this. Outstanding tasks gnaw at us only until we have a clear idea of how we will deal with them. Zeigarnik mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase them from memory. But it’s not; a good plan of action suffices"
