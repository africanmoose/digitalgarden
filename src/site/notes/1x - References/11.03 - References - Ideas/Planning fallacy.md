### Summary
- We tend to plan assuming everything will go well, and usually it doesn't.

### Details
- Focus on external things e.g. similar projects. look at the base rate for the past. Likely teh same or close will apply to your own project
- Plan for likely or even unlikely disasters (risk management). The extra planning may take a bit more time, but will result in a more reasonable plan
